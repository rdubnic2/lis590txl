<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/Little-Nightmares/">Little Nightmares</a> [<a href="http://www.little-nightmares.com/en/">official site</a>] is the story of a little girl in a horrible place. It’s a horror game but it’s mostly bloodless and doesn’t rely on jumpscares or sudden shocks. I’ve loved almost every minute of it.</p>, <p><span id="more-442231"></span></p>, <p>I’m going to get the Inside comparisons out of the way now so nobody is waiting for any revelations on that front. There are many similarities, not only in the macabre tone (both contain a lot of child death and an oppressive atmosphere; neither contains buckets of gore), but in the side-scrolling puzzling and occasional platforming. Get up close to Little Nightmares, however, and its rooms and corridors are constructed using entirely different techniques to those used by Playdead. The major difference is in Tarsier’s borrowing from survival horror, with stealth and hiding playing a key part. Little Nightmares may be a branch on the family tree that contains Limbo and Inside, but it has the vines of Clocktower wrapped around it as well.</p>, <p>Every scene is like a little constructed set, a dollshouse with the front walls peeled back to allow an interior view. Characters don’t have the jerky animation of stop motion figures, but they have a solidity. If Inside is mostly silhouettes and shadows, Tarsier’s game appears to be constructed using solid, physical entities. While it doesn’t have actual props and clay figures in its scenes, as The Dream Machine does, its art style and animations give a sense of practical effects rather than CGI.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/lnightmares1.jpg"/><br/>

That carries through from the visuals into the tactility of the world. There are plenty of objects, large and small, that can be picked up, dragged, thrown and toppled. Importantly, the spaces these objects exist in are fully 3D. Rather than being trapped to a 2D plane, as is the case with Inside and Another World, the other notable predecessor and reference point, Little Nightmares places your character on stages with depth to them. That not only allows for puzzles to spread out across the space and into the background, but creates extra room and pathways for pursuit and cowering.</p>, <p>There are a handful of stages in the game. They’re probably better referred to as acts or phases because they mark movement through the story, flowing together, rather than distinct shifts from one area to the next. What marks them out, more than a change of scenery, is a change in antagonist.</p>, <p>Little Nightmares is at its best when the nightmares are shuffling and snuffling around the place, larger than life, and trying to catch and eat you. If you’ve seen my earlier thoughts on the game, or the marketing campaign, you’ll probably be aware of the chefs. There are other creatures hunting the kitchens and dining rooms you’ll be sneaking through, including a horribly spider-like toymaker, who has <a href="https://twitter.com/noneconomical/status/785861121571975169">ruined a part of my childhood forever</a>.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/lnightmares3.jpg"/></p>, <p>One of the many things I love about the game is the confusion of scale that afflicts everything, from what appear to be people to furniture and food. Early on, a man hangs from the ceiling, his legs dangling near a chair that was presumably an instrumental part of his death. Compared to the player character, the chair is enormous and compared to the man, it’s too small to be functional. As you squeeze through tiny openings and try to go unnoticed, scuttling beneath cabinets and tables, it’s clear that this world wasn’t built for the likes of you, but it’s not entirely clear who it was built for. Nobody seems to fit quite right and there’s little comfort to be found anywhere.</p>, <p>It’s best to know nothing more than you’ve already read, here, before starting. Perhaps it’s OK to know that the game was originally called Hunger and that you’ll need to find morsels of food from time to time. Frustratingly, Little Nightmares didn’t earn my trust in its opening half hour. It’s a cold opening, without any pre-text or introductory video. You’re a small person in a big, scary place, and…now what?</p>, <p>Because this is a game, you’re probably going to run to the right and that’s good. But it’s very dark, and the place you’re in isn’t very interesting, and do you even have a way to shed some light on the situation. Well, you do. You have a lighter, but either the game doesn’t feel the need to tell you that you have it, or how to use it, or I started pressing buttons so fast I skipped whatever prompt might have appeared. Whatever the case, I half-admire the lack of exposition and hand-holding in the opening, but I also found the first area quite bland, and the lack of any real objective or purpose left me feeling a bit lost. And not in a good way.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/littlenightmares4.jpg"/></p>, <p>Things pick up relatively quickly, thankfully. Once Mister Limbs, as I unaffectionately call him, started to grope around in the dark, hunting for me, I was fully on-board. That slightly duff opening is a problem though, not only in that it gives a bad first impression, but because the game is so lean that it can’t really afford to accommodate any downtime. I’m all for short games, and Little Nightmares barely wastes any of its running time with padding or repetition, but it only took me around three hours to finish. The conclusion is very final but I was left wanting more in the middle: more monsters, more extraordinary views and grubby little rooms. More of the spectacular grotesque that the game displays in its finest moments.</p>, <p>It’s puzzles are simple but satisfying, usually solved simply by looking at the environment and figuring out where to climb, where to crawl or where best to run and hide. I was occasionally annoyed to find a drawer that needed to be opened, despite not looking any different to its jammed neighbours, or a climbable surface that didn’t stand out in the gloom. Now, I reckon those were daft things to be annoyed about. Little Nightmares gives you time and space to poke at and prod its environments, and that’s a good thing. You can rush through, and some rooms seem to exist just as set dressing, but unless something is breathing down your neck, it’s good to stop an appreciate the grim little world Tarsier have crafted.</p>, <p>Visually, it ended up reminding me of Edward Lear’s drawings and Gerald Scarfe’s work more than Tim Burton or Caro &amp; Jeunet, who I figured were likely inspirations based on early glimpses of the game. All of the visuals tie together thematically as well, and while the opening may be vague and suggest there’s no real direction to the plot, Little Nightmares is a wordless tale with a lot to say. There’s a great big dollop of Animal Farm mixed into the meal, along with the more explicitly monstrous scares. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/lnightmares5.jpg"/></p>, <p>And it is scary. Not in a way that left me sleepless and hiding under the blankets, or quitting to desktop and turning the lights back on, but in a way that made my skin crawl. Dying isn’t a terrible punishment, usually setting you back a couple of rooms at most, but there were times when I was so appalled by the idea of being caught be these <em>things</em> that when spotted, I’d find a safe spot and hide for far longer than it would have taken me to die, respawn and try again. Often, the terror is of that sort that makes children eager to hear the end of a fairytale even though people are being cannibalised, or that makes campfire ghost stories so much fun. It’s horror that makes you lean in rather than turn away.</p>, <p>I love it. There were times when I didn’t, mostly when I had to replay a section where I kept failing to line up what looked like a simple jump over and over, but by the end I was smitten. It’s a grotesque, horrid and eventually hopeful in its own morbid fashion, and despite many moments that feel like reimaginings or echoes from elsewhere, it has enough extraordinary images and sequences to stand alone. It’s precisely the kind of horror game I love – grotesque but not gross, and interested in thoughtful pacing and escalation rather than jumpscares and shocks. Also, linear though it is, there are some collectibles I’d like to hunt for and the whole game is short enough that I’ll happily play it again, or watch someone else playing.</p>, <p><em>Little Nightmares is out April 27th for Windows, and is available to preorder from <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/424840/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/news/preorder_little_nightmares">GOG</a>, both for £15.99.

<a class="featured-block__text featured-block__text--feature" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/category/featured-articles">RPS Feature</a>
The Emperor will be mostly pleased </p>, <p>By <a href="mailto:fraser.i.brown@googlemail.com">Fraser Brown</a> on April 20th, 2017 at 3:01 pm.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/DoW3-1.jpg"/></p>, <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/Warhammer-40000:-Dawn-of-War-III/">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 3</a> [<a href="https://www.dawnofwar.com/">official site</a>] wants to be everything you like about the series, and its very different predecessors, in a single RTS. Missed the big armies and the base building? They’re back. Prefer fighting with beefy heroic units with lots of special abilities? They’re here too. It’s trying to be all things to all men, women, Orks and Eldar, and crikey does it come close to succeeding. So close you can hear the heavy metal roar of an Ork Waaagh tower and the thudding of Space Marine boots.</p>, <p><span id="more-441927"></span></p>, <p>For the first time, Relic have put all three of their favourite factions on equal footing straight away instead of holding all but the Space Marines back for expansions. The heavily armoured space fascists, Orks and Eldar share the spotlight in both the campaign and multiplayer – a relief after the spate of Space Marine-only affairs. And it’s in the design of these factions that Relic have done some of their strongest work.</p>, <p>Each group scratches an itch. The Emperor’s finest are like a fist smashing a face: punchy. They charge and leap with bolters blasting and swords held high, getting into brawls quickly and pinning down fleshy foes with big hammers and even bigger knockbacks. They’re as subtle as a fart in an elevator, as evidenced by their special ability: they can queue up drop pods, containing more Space Marines, primed to be dropped right on the heads of their foes.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/DoW3-2.jpg"/></p>, <p>The Eldar and Orks aren’t quite as intuitive, but benefit from an additional layer of complexity. The former, along with their speed and predilection for fast, ranged strikes, can link up buildings to create a web of teleporters, and even teleport the buildings themselves. They’re perfect for hit-and-run tactics and surprise assaults. Their green enemies, on the other hand, overwhelm with numbers and the power of their psychic rage – the Waaagh. They grow in strength as they loot and salvage scrap to be used for upgrades, new vehicles and additional Waaagh towers. </p>, <p>While all three factions feature a broad range of line units, from melee units that can lock down enemies to ranged troops who fire devastating weapons that need time to set up, they still feel fundamentally different. Here’s an example of Marine combat.</p>, <p>Gabriel Angelos and a couple of squads of Tactical Marines are surrounded by pumped-up Orks, roaring and flailing with their cruel axes. They’re outnumbered, health rapidly being whittled down, and they can’t make it back to their base. Angelos, an Elite and thus blessed with more health and a suite of handy abilities, could make a break for it. He could leap over the Orks and leg it to safety, leaving his men behind. Instead, he leaps up, not over, and when he lands in the centre of the green tide, every enemy in the area flies backwards. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/DoW3-3.jpg"/></p>, <p>With extra breathing room, Angelos’ troops open fire, but they’re quickly forced back into desperate melee duels by another wave of enemies – enemies too busy to watch the skies. A roaring noise competes with the din of battle followed by, seconds later, two explosions. Two more rings of Orks are flung backwards. The drop pod doors open up with fresh soldiers pouring out, setting up firing positions and chasing down fleeing Nobz and Boyz.</p>, <p>Swap out the Space Marines for Eldar and the story changes. With their speed and penchant for slowing enemies, they really shouldn’t be surrounded in the first place, but if they are, they’re in a bit of a pickle. A whole jar of pickles. Eldar have a lot of strengths, but sustained melee engagements ain’t one of them – they crumble faster than me after a brisk jog, which is to say very quickly and with no small amount of embarrassment. Still, there are ways for them to escape using clouds of smoke and handy stuns, but if they choose to duke it out with the Orks, they won’t come out of it nearly as well as Angelos and his buds. </p>, <p>Some people will scoff at the idea that MOBAs can teach RTS games anything, but the MOBA inspiration behind unit design and ability synergy is a massive boon here. Though not quite as developed as the heroes from the likes of Dota or Heroes of the Storm, every unit – not just the Elites – has a hook and an ability that make them a valuable part of a team. And this goes well beyond the rock, paper, scissors formula. The value of a unit is more fluid, more situational, and depends on the squads around them creating opportunities. </p>, <p>It would be lovely, though, if everyone could maybe die… less? Or at least at a slower rate. It’s a bit of a jump from the incredibly hardy but small squads of Dawn of War 2 to these considerably more vulnerable facsimiles. It’s hard to get invested in a unit when they could get wiped out in a few seconds. It’s almost like Space Marine armour is actually made out of polystyrene. Sure, it’s lighter, and it’s probably more comfortable, but is comfort worth dying over? </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/DoW3-4.jpg"/></p>, <p>The scarcity of properly hardy soldiers is something I could perhaps live with if there were more ways to mitigate damage. Unfortunately, after experimenting with a cover system in DoW2, Relic have chucked it in the bin in favour of no cover system at all. There are capturable areas that provide a destructible shield, but there’s no guarantee that you’ll be fighting anywhere near one; nor is one bit of cover really going to stop a lot of your troops from being riddled with holes. I like the clarity of these defensible positions, but there’s no flexibility. The result is that a great number of fights are pitched battles in open areas.</p>, <p>Line of sight and high ground have an impact, and hidden units – either through an ability or an area that cloaks them – mean that sneak attacks and ambushes are perfectly viable tactics, so battles are never just a matter of smashing armies together, but there’s no real room for a defensive player. As well as a dearth of cover to hide behind, there are incredibly few fortification options and units aren’t capable of being garrisoned in buildings. This is especially strange when you consider the multiplayer mode, which involves protecting your team’s power core while trying to take out the opposition’s. </p>, <p>Everyone is on the offensive in multiplayer. You might, like I did at first, build up your forces, protect some important resource points, and keep an eye on your power core, but you won’t make many friends, and your allies will probably blame you for the loss. Maybe they’re assholes, but they might also be right. If you’re not constantly harassing the enemy, taking out their Elites, and generally getting up to mischief, then you’re probably not helping. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/DoW3-5.jpg"/></p>, <p>That’s not really the important bit, mind. Who cares what your team thinks? The real problem is that playing defensively is so incredibly, dreadfully, mind-numbingly dull. Got a couple of guys hiding behind some smoke? Placed someone in the magical shield bubble? Great, you’re pretty much done. Build some more units, I guess? So now you’re bored and you aren’t really helping. </p>, <p>That aside, Dawn of War 3’s multiplayer battles are still great. 3v3 in particular is a glorious mess of clashing armies and territorial punch-ups. Here’s the gist: two teams duke it out over their respective power cores, each placed at opposite ends of the map. To take out a power core, at least one of the turrets protecting it must be destroyed, and to take out a turret, you’ve got to take out the shield generator protecting it. And to keep the conflict going at all times, resource points dot the map and create new objectives for players to fight over. </p>, <p>With so many targets and an escalation system that increases resource generation and building health every 10 minutes, there’s an aggressive, relentless flow to these battles, and first blood is usually spilled within the first minute. With drop pods falling from the skies, buildings teleporting willy-nilly and giant Elite units slaughtering entire squads in seconds, it can be chaotic and sometimes hard to parse, but this chaos is also the source of some of the most exhilarating RTS brawls I’ve had the pleasure to win and lose. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/DoW3-6.jpg"/></p>, <p>While the constant attack, attack, attack might seem repetitive, there’s plenty of diversity when it comes to choosing how you’re going to be aggressive. See, before every multiplayer match, and to a lesser extent campaign mission, you choose a loadout – three MOBA-like Elites and six doctrines, essentially augments and buffs. These can dramatically change the tone of your forces, or shore up any gaps in their capabilities.</p>, <p>Orks aren’t very sneaky. They are too loud and, let’s face it, too smelly for stealth. But with the right combination of Elites and doctrines, they can be almost as sly as the Eldar. Zapnoggin’, for instance, can teleport groups of Orks into or out of trouble with his fancy Ork magic, while one of their doctrines allows them to hide underneath the scrap they normally use to unlock new weapons and armour, littering the battlefield with potential ambush sites.</p>, <p>Doctrines and Elites require skulls before they can be unlocked, however. You can earn a fair amount of currency from the campaign and keep earning it through multiplayer matches. I’m still not entirely convinced by the unnecessarily complicated system, however. You’ve got army doctrines that are, not surprisingly, army wide; presence doctrines, which only work if the Elite they’re connected to is present on the battlefield; and command doctrines that work when a specific Elite is in your loadout. Then you’ve got to take into account levels, because command doctrines can only be unlocked when an Elite reaches level 3, and when it hits level 8 that same doctrine can be unlocked as an army doctrine and… I’m losing you, I know I am. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/DoW3-7.jpg"/></p>, <p>I’m some 1,600 words into this Wot I Think and you’re probably starting to notice that I’ve been avoiding the campaign. Unfortunately this is not because I’ve been building up to Dawn of War 3’s best feature. Nothing about it works for me. Not the paper-thin characters, not the plodding story, not the endless journeys across maps that keep growing. There are a few individual missions that I’ve definitely clicked with, but as a whole, the campaign is…well, it’s a disappointment. It’s the one place where Relic’s attempt to merge elements from the two earlier games doesn’t really work, and the juxtaposition of linear, scripted missions with base building is incredibly awkward, cursing many missions with a confusing pace. </p>, <p>They usually start out by limiting your army to a handful of squads and forcing you down a bunch of corridors, fighting your way from A to B. Without wrinkles like cover, suppression and resources, it feels more like Diablo than an RTS. Sometimes, that’s the entire mission. A few squads and an Elite, jogging from one end of the map to the other. The majority, however, let you start building a base during the second phase of the mission. That’s when things start to feel like a strategy romp again, with armies duking it out over capture points and assaulting each other’s HQs. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/DoW3-8.jpg"/></p>, <p>I’d still do terrible things for a more reactive campaign AI, mind you. It feels like enemies never really act unless the invisible director tells them to. When they attack, it’s because they’ve reached that point in the mission when they’re meant to try to take out your base. When fast patrols start scouting and hunting down your minions, it’s because it’s part of a secondary objective, not just something an enemy with common sense would do.</p>, <p>Aside from Homeworld, Relic’s best campaigns tend to be non-linear and based around capturing territory across one or more campaign maps – a simulation of actual warfare. It’s desperately needed here. Without it, there aren’t enough decisions for players to make. From start to finish, the campaign feels like you’re playing someone else’s story, not your own. And while decent RTS campaigns increasingly feel like my white whale, I can usually depend on Relic for something better.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/DoW3-9.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are moments, many of them, during multiplayer and AI skirmishes, where I’m absolutely certain that Dawn of War 3 is the best game in the series, even with its missteps when it comes to cover and fortifications. I could happily continue rambling on about the brilliant faction design or how I still squeal with glee every time I drop a gargantuan beast of an Elite like Imperial Knight Solaria into a fight – you haven’t lived until you’ve witnessed her impossibly huge guns turning an army of Orks into green-red paste. If you’re only interested in the campaign, however, then you’re unlikely to find as much to get enthused about.

Lots of people have tried to make educational games. Few have succeeded. Odyssey [<a href="http://theodysseygame.com/">official site</a>] gets closer than most, in its efforts to teach about physics, astronomy and mechanics. It’s been in early access for a while, but comes out today, accompanied by a price drop. Here’s wot I think:<span id="more-441695"></span></p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/od01.jpg"/></p>, <p>Odyssey, despite the rather bold choice of name, is about following in the steps of a family who recently explored the Wretched Isles – a fictional group of tiny islands in the Caribbean, once populated by Island Caribs until an invasion of pirates in the mid-17th century. Last populated by the US army in the Second World War, the Rao family has gained permission to visit the out-of-bounds rocks to do some research during the summer holidays. You, it seems, are brmming a boat somewhere nearby when you hear the distress call of the clan’s 13 year-old daughter, Kai, so stop off to see what’s what.</p>, <p>What follows is a first-person adventure-cum-puzzler that at first glance looks like a homemade version of The Witness. Odd boards and electric grids are rigged about around the place, and progress is gained by solving the puzzles thereon. But it soon becomes clear this is a lot less about esoteric brainteasers, and much more about exploring astronomy from first principles.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/od04.jpg"/></p>, <p>I love the ambitions behind Odyssey. It wants to educate, and not in a tiresomely deceptive way, but up front with books and diagrams and practical application through puzzles. It crafts a rather odd setting to do this, but hey, who doesn’t love exploring an abandoned island? But even so, there’s a point where it starts to feel too disingenuous. Sure, this family’s on an island during the holidays, professor parents wanting to explore some old world mysteries with their teenage daughter – your scribe – and her older brother Sid, brought along. And sure, science boff dad can’t help but want to feed his daughter’s curious mind as they go, fixing bridges, exploring pirate interference, directing her to keep a detailed journal about both the present adventures and the science she’s being taught. I’ll even accept the completely ridiculous conceit that the puzzles you’re solving to gain progress are there to prevent some unknown baddies from reaching the family, with pages ripped from Kai’s journal left nearby for – er – I guess me to read and solve.</p>, <p>But there comes a point where this utterly un-13-like 13 year old is dryly describing her experiments to learn why a disc and a ball are lit differently by a light source, in order to understand how ancient folks knew the moon was a sphere. And she explains that she does this using her “project supplies”, items “half stuff you get from a craft store and half salvaged from the junkyard near my house, including a bunch of these cool crank wheels that make gears and sliders go back and forth.”</p>, <p>“Cool crank wheels.”</p>, <p>That she brought along, on a boat trip, to a remote island that no one is supposed to have stood on since World War II. She just has those cool crank wheels and sliders with her, in her suitcase, like any 13 year old would.</p>, <p>Oh come on.</p>, <p>“I mounted a light on a track, to act like the sun, between the two moons so I could crank it forward and backward. I could have just held the models up to the light, but I wanted to be precise.”</p>, <p><em>Oh come on.</em></p>, <p>And it definitely isn’t helpful that the game’s opening monologue sounds uncannily like Vanessa Bayer’s SNL character Laura Parsons.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LcW-fEr1vT0?ecver=1" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>The larger mistake, beyond the stretched credulity of the format, is the balance of playing to reading. Just three or four puzzles in I’d already read 49 pages of journal. FORTY-NINE. And once I’ve finished reading the latest lengthy batch there’s then a puzzle relating to that sun/moon light machine that takes approximately thirty seconds, revealing the next wad of pages to read. Another eight pages of dense text. And four pages of this is, I swear, an aching justification for an impossibly complicated room-size combination puzzle to lower a ladder.</p>, <p>Solve it, and the ladder comes down with another <em>twelve</em> pages of diary.</p>, <p>Now, there’s nothing really wrong with these diaries. They don’t read like any thirteen-year-old who has ever existed, and I fear that lack of authenticity will do much to put off its target audience of inquisitive teens, but that’s not the end of the world. And in fact, the way the entries approach the subjects of how pre-enlightenment scientists and astronomers were able to identify the spherical nature of the Earth, and the orbits of the solar system, are brilliantly approached. It comes at everything from first principle, with Kia encouraged by her father to try to work out how the peoples of these islands could have reached the knowledge she’s been given.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/od02.jpg"/></p>, <p>Kia is smart, and likes to build models to process her thinking, and this all means as the player you learn alongside her. You, a grown up, have likely heard a good few of the reasons we can discern the not-flatness of the Earth, but it addresses the many arguments that were made over the last couple of thousand years in careful and precise terms, almost as if a primer for anyone wanting to make a flat-Earther idiot get out of their Twitter mentions in a hurry. The problem is, it does all this in text on pretend paper on your screen, rather than in what you do in the brief portions of actually playing.</p>, <p>Yes there are puzzles where you align the sun, moon and Earth such that you can see the shadows cast, but these always come long after you’ve done the reading and been given the conclusions, and usually not to demonstrate what you’ve been told, but instead to point an arrow at a picture so you can open a door. Go down a zipwire, and then… <em>thirty</em> more pages of diary to read.</p>, <p>In those thirty pages are two highlighted paragraphs, which hint to where you should position the celestial models Kia’s been writing about – 30 seconds later you’ve got another twenty-seven pages of handwritten astrophysics to read.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/od07.jpg"/></p>, <p>I absolutely did not know that ancient astronomers considered the Sun and moon to be planets, while the Earth not. I knew very little about the rationale behind the geocentric solar system, and it’s really interesting to learn about it. I’m tempted to say, “But I’d much rather have read about it in a book…” but that’s not really true. I love buying books, but I’m not so great at reading them – the reality is, I wasn’t going to have stumbled on this information were it not for this game.</p>, <p>The problem is, the failed potential for this as a <em>game</em>. A sentiment best captured by, er, the game. In one of those 30-page chunks, as I read about Kia’s practical experiments to try to disprove Aristotle’s geocentric model, she recounts a conversation with her father about how pleased he is she’s doing all this. As he introduces Copernicus to the story, she writes,</p>, <p>“Dad said I was retracing that debate, and he was extremely happy about it, because real science is about investigation and discovery, not just reading the words of a textbook author.”</p>, <p>Oops.</p>, <p>The irony is a little sore.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/od09.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are exceptions. When it’s teaching about the retrograde motion of Mars, and how this can be proven in both geocentric and heliocentric models, you do get to play with (outlandishly complex) machines to see this in action. That makes a difference. But it’s still so dismissive, there to be a puzzle, rather than an application. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/od05.jpg"/></p>, <p>And so it goes on and on. I admit I’ve not finished it. I’m 200-something pages into this diary, and it’s getting into Aristotle’s mistaken beliefs about the speed of falling object’s, and Kia’s exhaustive experiments to prove him wrong. And still all the learning is taking place in the book, the puzzles really only tangentially related.</p>, <p>It calls itself “The Next Generation Science Game”, but the reality is this feels like something very last generation. Not just the somewhat clunky graphics (they’re nice enough, but look a good few years old), but the whole approach feels like something that misunderstands how games can really be applied to education. Just look at Minecraft, for goodness sakes, to see that it’s about experimentation and application, not book reading and tests. I think there will be kids who will really appreciate this, but I suspect it’ll be those who would have enjoyed being given a textbook about the subject almost as much. I really cannot see it drawing in the crowds to accidentally learn physics and astronomy while they play. Mostly because there’s almost no playing! I love that it’s tried, and it certainly is no disaster. But I really can’t work out exactly who or what it’s for.

The cassette tape in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series/">Telltale’s Guardians of the Galaxy</a> [<a href="https://telltale.com/series/guardiansofthegalaxy/">official site</a>] is called ‘Rad Mix’ instead of ‘Awesome Mix.’ A crueller man than I might observe that this is all we really need to know about Telltale’s not-based-on-the-film-and-yet-kinda-is spin on the adventures of Rocket, Groot and chums. I.e., that it really, <em>really</em> wants to be be just like what is arguably the most purely entertaining superhero film on the past decade, but it can’t quite pull it off.</p>, <p>I’m not that cruel. Not quite.<span id="more-441661"></span></p>, <p>To get it out of the way right at the start, don’t look to this to break with the now-familiar Telltale formula – not in this first episode at least. It’s essentially a string of attractive cutscenes interspersed with a few mild quicktime events to direct the action, and conversational options that in theory have major effects on the outcome but more realistically simply enable you to modulate your character’s personality to a greater or lesser extent. </p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-PN5KA8dBg?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>GOTG turns the polish dial up a little (lovely lighting! proper anti-aliasing!), and in one key action/quicktime event sequence has your control grasshopper-leaping between the five main characters, but otherwise it’s the interactive movie that this studio is so known for – yer Walking Dead, yer Batman, yer Game Of Thrones, yer Wolf Among Us. </p>, <p>If anything, there’s an even keener sense than usual that this was created as script first, interactive elements second. Sometimes, being handed a crumb of control felt like almost an afterthought – a grudging acknowledgement that this wasn’t just an excuse for writers, artists and actors to play in one of Marvel’s most colourful playgrounds.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/got2.jpg"/></p>, <p>I’ve made my peace with this in Telltale games, though I do appreciate it when they try something a little more ambitious, such as the ambush-planning in their Batman series. I’m not telling this videdogame that it should be a completely different sort of videogame – I just wanted to be clear that you should play this because you want another story about Star Lord and his mates, not because you hope it’s some grand exercise in either action or choice and consequence.</p>, <p>I watched GOTG1 on the telly the day before playing this, so I was all primed for another bout of jokes, incompetence, squabbling, spaceships and contrived friendship-saves-the-day resolutions. In hindsight, perhaps this was a mistake, because it threw the realisation that, compared to the original act, this game is basically a pub cover band into sharp relief. </p>, <p>I don’t mind a pub cover band. I don’t mind GOTG either. It’s just that, realistically, there’s no hope of convincing myself this is the real deal. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/got3.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s not the fact that this, like the Batman games, is Telltale’s own universe rather than either film or comic canon. That’s only sensible, really.</p>, <p>It’s not the fact that it doesn’t have any of the same actors, or that three of the main characters look dramatically different from their cinema appearance. (They’re based, presumably for licensing reasons, more on the comic look, but hybridised with a fair few elements from the film, particularly in terms of personality and backstory). </p>, <p>It’s not the core plot, which mixes some arguably over-familiar origin story beats with a mildly shocking fresh setup of its own.</p>, <p>It’s the fact that it is so heavily influenced by a propulsive, sparky action-comedy movie but is hamstrung by constant slowdowns that devastate its pacing. Sadly, many of these slowdowns are a consequence of it being an uneven combination of showy cutscenes and limited interactivity. When Star Lord has to walk somewhere, he does so achingly slowly, in what I imagine is supposed to be an approximation of Chris Pratt’s swagger but looks more like his underwear just took an unexpected hit.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/got4.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s a collision of license and game style, really. I mean, Batman was suited to a certain amount of hanging around, either on top of gargoyles or at boring posh parties, but the Guardians’ silver screen thing is that they’re almost always getting on with it and only worrying about the consequences after the fact. </p>, <p>This, by contrast, has far more in the way of sitting around worrying about <em>feelings</em>, and in addition slow-paced basic investigation of an area. Very often, it’ll also have its cast break into poses, aping the steady stream of hero shots in the film. It makes a gag out of this once, to its credit, but otherwise it’s just one more type of waiting in a tale that clearly, clearly wants to race on ahead but has had to make concessions in the name of being both a videogame and a close-as-lawyers-allow recreation of the film.</p>, <p>To be clear, the slowdowns – the unhurried wanders back and forth to talk to people or grab a single item from an otherwise non-interactive room – wouldn’t grate if this was ‘just’ a Telltale game, as opposed to a Telltale game that so very badly wants to be a Guardians of the Galaxy animated movie more than it does a Telltale game. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/got5.jpg"/></p>, <p>Which rather begs a final question – is this a good Guardians of the Galaxy animated movie? It’s alright. It’s probably rather comparable to what an actual GOTG animated movie would be, in fact, or reading some of the less accomplished comic runs – reasonably well done, but a distant second to the live action movie. The gags aren’t as good, the performances aren’t as charismatic, the spectacle is more serviceable than spectacular, the baddies have less presence, the emotional beats are a little too earnest for their own good. Honestly, it’s alright, but, yeah, don’t do what I do and play it right after watching the film.</p>, <p>I had a reasonable time with it. I found the awkward pacing distracting, but really my main issue with it is that it squanders its chance to make a true team game and instead locks you into playing as Star Lord for all but one sequence – because that’s how other Telltale games work. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/18guardians.jpg"/></p>, <p>There’s a suggestion that the remaining four episodes will each be focused on a different member of the team, which I look forwards to (particularly, I’d like to see Gamora given a rare opportunity to get the best lines, which even the film denies her), but it’s not the same as switching between them frequently to resolve situations in a manner of your choosing. </p>, <p>Instead, the slow focus of both this first episode and, it seems, the whole series, is of dividing the team, both physically and emotionally, for surely inevitable re-connection at the end. The obvious route for wringing drama out of the tale, yes, but I wish it had a more distinctive hook than ‘friends get cross with each other.’ </p>, <p>There is another, better hook, in fact, which I alluded to earlier and can’t say much more about, but it has a shot at rewriting the Guardians rulebook. I don’t think it’s going to ultimately take that shot – there’s something of a Chekov’s spacegun in play that is likely to undo the twist – but I enjoyed its relative boldness nevertheless.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/got6.jpg"/></p>, <p>In short, then? Pretty much exactly what you might have expected from the Walking Dead folks doing Guardians. Which is to say competent enough as these things go, but far less suited to manic action-comedy than it is to languid angst and survival. </p>, <p>Oh, and it’s got a 70s and 80s soundtrack – the Rad Mix – featuring songs not quite as effective as those on the film’s Awesome Mix. Figures. Nice ELO number, mind you.

Full Throttle Remastered</a> [<a href="http://fullthrottle.doublefine.com/">official site</a>] is the return of perhaps the most under-appreciated of the classic 90s LucasArts adventures. Double Fine’s remastering will hopefully go a long way to seeing it gain a reputation among a new generation. Here’s wot I think:<span id="more-441617"></span></p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/thro8b.jpg"/></p>, <p>There’s a temptation to take my review of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/03/21/day-of-the-tentacle-remastered-review/">Day Of The Tentacle Remastered</a>, then Find/Replace “DOTT” for “Full Throttle”. Double Fine are onto a good thing here, taking some of the best loved games of the 1990s, redrawing the art, remixing the sound, and releasing them in working condition for modern PCs. May they not stop at LucasArts games, and do the rest of the industry too. It can feel difficult to add much more to the discussion, because if you hate the new art but love the new sound, switch the first off and the second on. It’s Full Throttle, it’s the same great-but-flawed adventure, the same gorgeously detailed but far too short tale of biker Ben in a future world where cars no longer have wheels.</p>, <p>Then of course it occurs to me not everyone is ancient. While there’s pretty much no excuse for not knowing about Day Of The Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max: Hit The Road, it’s far more feasible that someone not born before the 90s would have entirely missed Full Throttle. Not because it didn’t succeed – it was one of LucasArt’s most successful adventures, selling well over a million copies, ten times what they’d expected. But it’s the one that’s mentioned after DOTT, S&amp;M, Grim Fandango, Fate Of Atlantis, and of course the Monkey Island series. It can lay claim to a greater place in people’s memories than LOOM, sure, but it’s fair to say it hasn’t received the long-term adulation given elsewhere. And that’s not really fair.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/thro4a.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/thro4b.jpg"/></p>, <p>Schafer’s ’90 heydays saw his projects become increasingly meaningful to him, delving into a world or a theme in an intimate manner, and perhaps never better than in Grim Fandango. But Full Throttle was a loving look at the land of the grease monkey, setting the more usually villainous biker character as the hero in a near-future setting where cars fly and only one company makes motorcycles any more. A company that is being brought down from within with the intention of making minivans. <em>Minivans</em>.</p>, <p>The evil Adrian Ripburger (voiced by Mark Hamill, with an early demonstration of his penchant for growly-throated baddie types) murders Malcolm Corley, the founder and CEO of Corley Motors, and frames biker gang The Polecats for the crime. Ben, the gang’s leader, is your character, now on the run from the police and aided by Maureen Corley, daughter of the now-late Malcolm. And so it is that you inventory puzzle your way through a beautifully painted, murky world of desert roads and run-down provinces, proving your innocence and saving the wheel.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/thro2a.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/thro2b.jpg"/></p>, <p>On release, Full Throttle was perhaps the first sign of adventure fatigue from critics. It was 1995, and the flawless DOTT and S&amp;M had in years past rightly received rave reviews from everywhere, inducing everyone else in the industry to try to copy. The press were perhaps looking to take LucasArts down a peg, and Full Throttle provided the opportunity. It was short, the puzzles were simpler, and it had some absolutely god-awful action sequences. It didn’t receive a drubbing, of course – but it did represent the beginnings of the tedious decision that the time of the adventure was coming to an end. It was the turning point, from “YAY ADVENTURES!” to the incessant idiocy of “Adventure games are dead, apart from this one,” on every release.</p>, <p>Length really was the issue most focused on – something that just seems bizarre today in our world of hundred-million-dollar six hour FPS games. But games were big back then, and Full Throttle’s tale not taking so long to tell felt unusual. Something exacerbated by the other anachronistic notion from those Days Of Yore: puzzles.</p>, <p>It’s impossible to believe today, but people used to get stuck on a game and respond by stopping and thinking about it for a few hours, maybe overnight. Impossible. Try to believe it… See? And yet it was true. Full Throttle wanted to move away from that, and in that ideology was deeply prescient of where the genre (and all of gaming) was heading. It wanted to offer challenges that could be solved there and then, with some hard thinking. It’s completely bonkers that today the challenges in FT are <em>FAR</em> harder than anything you’d get in a present-day point-and-clicker, but at the time not needing to wait for the next issue of your favourite gaming magazine in hope that particular puzzle might be solved in the back pages was considered <a href="https://twitter.com/noneconomical/status/854695666827882496">anus</a>. And indeed sped up the process of playing an already shorter game.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/thro9a.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/thro9b.jpg"/></p>, <p>As with last year’s DOTT, Double Fine have done a really lovely job updating, especially with the sound. You can switch back and forth between the original mono monotony, and the superbly remixed version, and there’s no contest – crisp, clear voices over unfuzzy music – it’s a joy. And no more joyous than the late Roy Conrad’s stunning performance as Ben. What a treat to hear his euphonious growling voice so distinctly. They’ve also made some neat tweaks to the interface, the contextual pop-up click menu no longer needing the mouse button to be held down, for instance. (Although you can set that back if you’re mad.) The art is going to be far more in the eye of the beholder, but it’s undeniably faithful to the original.</p>, <p>DOTT’s remaster resulted in scenes that looked far better for being updated, and others that looked worse. I think Full Throttle sees a lot more of the latter, but because the original was just so beautiful. As I obsessively F1 between the original and remastered version in every scene, sometimes I wonder at how blurry and ill-defined key objects were on the screen, and am grateful for the improvements. But it never looks aesthetically better. The original pixel art was some of the best ever, and something is distinctly lost in the upgrading process.</p>, <p>I believe that’s a result of the process, rather than a condemnation of the new art. In trying to remain faithful to the original design, the art is restricted in a way that means it just isn’t suited. I imagine the same team given the freedom to draw the scenes to their own vision could do something lovely with the style, but for me, here, it feels less than the original.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/thro01.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are, unfortunately, some elements that are rather shoddy. A new ability to highlight interactive objects by pressing Shift is poorly implemented, with key objects missed and areas showing highlights where there’s nothing. Plus all the new menus look haphazardly thrown together, the instruction screens especially amateurish, looking like a late 90s Geocities site. It’s oddly tacky, unreflective of the core game, and disappointingly slapdash. There’s also a very welcome optional audio commentary, containing some lovely #bants about the game’s development from the original team, but they’ve been put in <em>really</em> strangely.</p>, <p>Chatter for a scene is triggered by pressing A, but is sometimes peculiarly incongruous to that moment. And frustratingly, it doesn’t bother to note if you’ve listened, so will prompt you to press A again on return only to hear the same thing again. Yet sometimes it may have updated, so you’ll want to check. Nrrgghh. Weirder still, it’ll sometimes come in uninvited over cutscenes, meaning it collides with the in-game dialogue for a bit of chatter you can’t listen to again after. The audio quality for the commentary is also really poor, everyone at different levels, the sound hissy and untidy, with conversation abruptly cut off at seemingly arbitrary points. Such a shame, as what’s being said is generally splendid.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/thro10a.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/thro10b.jpg"/></p>, <p>The ability to tweak it to the version of Full Throttle you want (I’d recommend the wonderful original art with the excellent new sound and music) rules out most complaints you could have. It needs another pass for minor bugs mentioned above, but nothing is serious. In the end, this is Full Throttle made playable once again, and that’s something to be celebrated. It’s a really fantastic game, with a lovely story, and brilliant performances. And out of its original timeline it’s free to just be itself, not compared to the last or the next LucasArts adventure to hit the shelves. If you loved the original, this is worth buying for the improved sound alone. If you never played it, then oh my goodness, hurry up!</p>, <p><em>Full Throttle Remastered is out now for Windows Steam, Humble and GOG for £11/$15/€15 (although currently sporting a 20% discount)

Every week we pit Brendan against the thousands of half-formed games of early access in a doomed battle for supremacy. This time, the huge and ridiculous fights of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/ultimate-epic-battle-simulator/">Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator</a>.</i></p>, <p>There’s not much in UEBS that isn’t possible in any of the Total War series. I mean, if you discount the ability to pit masterly Chickens against a force of Orcs. Apart from that, it’s still about arranging vast (or small) armies on large maps and having them go at each other until one force comes out of the meat grinder without losing all their wee men. In fact, it’s hundreds of times more limited than a real strategy game. But many would say that’s not the point. What you have here is a toy, something that aims for the simplicity of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadliest_Warrior">Deadliest Warrior</a> conceit and – just barely – hits the mark. But what kind of brawls can you create? Well, here’s four epic battles we threw together to find out.Originally it was 60,000 Persians, in an attempt to model the infamous battle of Thermopopomopolae. I would have conscripted more men to help fit the legendary version of events, but the game groaned under the weight, the frame rate stuttered, and then my monitor exploded and sent splinters of pixels into my eyes. So I bumped down the Persian soldier count to 45,000 and kicked the graphics quality settings down the stairs. It looks a lot less pretty now, but it works.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/2uebs_2.jpg"/></p>, <p>As soon as the battle began, I realised something was wrong. In the set-up menu you can give the units basic orders – hold position or attack. I thought I had ordered the ogres to stand their ground in a canyon, to better recreate the Hawt Gates of the famous Greek battle. But I quickly discovered that there had been a terrible mix-up. The ogres were now flooding out of the canyon and advancing on the Persian mega-army. The Persians, meanwhile, were standing in the open, waiting patiently for the ogres to arrive, looking with bored, expressionless faces at the oncoming horrors.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/2uebs_3.jpg"/></p>, <p>But there was another problem. I had chosen this map because it was the only one with a narrow canyon (I know there wasn’t really snow at the battle of Thereminorolypoly, come on). But I had neglected to take note of the map’s name – “Avalanche Canyon”. Before the ogres even entered the clearing, they had already lost almost 100 of their number to huge boulders collapsing down on them. A third of their forces had been destroyed before a single Persian sword was swung.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/2uebs_4.jpg"/></p>, <p>When they finally reached the field, the ogres cut into the square of humans like it was a block of soft cheese. They killed 6000 men before they finally succumbed to the blows of the Persian blades. When viewed from above, it looked like someone had taken a bite out of a giant piece of toast.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/3uebs_5.jpg"/></p>, <p>So ended the battle of Thermopopoppadom.</p>, <p><strong><i>Winner: Patient Persians.</i></strong></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/uebs_6.jpg"/></p>, <p>A zombie horde. A Mediterranean town. A fight with impossible odds. This summer, only six men stand between the undead and the end of the world. What men? It’s <em>[movie title appears on screen]</em> Six Better-Than-Average US Soldiers I Created From The Custom Unit Editor.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/uebs_17.jpg"/></p>, <p>You can fiddle with the stats of any character model in UEBS, you see. As such, I wanted to see if the explosive heroism of your average blockbuster could play out here. I made the US soldiers from the WWII era much more powerful than usual, with a faster fire rate. Then I plopped six of them down on a roof in the middle of a dusty town, with only one set of stairs leading up, facing a huge force of zeds invading the outskirts of town. This time I got the ‘hold position’ orders correct.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/uebs_7.jpg"/></p>, <p>But as the fight starts I find out that only three of the six soldiers have spawned. The other three must have fallen through the floor or something. I consider restarting but carry on with the blockbuster, deciding that half the men only makes it TWICE as heroic. Unfortunately, the soldiers take their orders very seriously and will not move or relocate even when the horde is on the street below, even when the rotting corpses are climbing the stairs, even when they stand right next to the soldiers, slashing at them with their bony man-talons. There is no “skirmish” tactic that lets them retreat when a foe is near.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/uebs_8.jpg"/></p>, <p>What’s worse, the elite soldiers don’t understand to pick the most pressing targets, instead choosing to fire down into the endless crowd rather than the zombie two feet to their left. Two of the soldiers die and I take control of the last survivor using a “possession” mechanic (you simply right-click on any troop and you’re in control of them). I leap off the corner of the building in an effort to escape. I break all the bones in my body and die.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/uebs_9.jpg"/></p>, <p><strong><i>Winner: Zombie horde.</i></strong></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/uebs_10.jpg"/></p>, <p>Having enjoyed the dumb brawling of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/for-honor/">For Honor</a> (despite all <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/21/everything-wrong-with-for-honor/">its problems</a>) I decided to make my own tiny match of it with the toys on offer here. I put the Vikings (here called ‘Wild Men’) aside and ignored the fact there are no Samurai yet included in the battle editor. Instead I pitted these three ahistorical mates against each other in the tight courtyard of a European fortress. Knights, Romans, Spartanmen.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/uebs_11.jpg"/></p>, <p>This was, unsurprisingly, the quickest battle of the lot. The Knights, sandwiched between the others, were at a disadvantage and died quickly. But not as quickly as the Romans, who wilted like unwatered lillies at the briefest touch of a Spartan spear. At the end of the fight all six Spartans remained, surrounded by foolish corpses.</p>, <p><i><strong>Winner: Spartmans.</strong> </i></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/uebs_12.jpg"/></p>, <p>The battle began as the sun rose. The penguin stared out at his frosty domain. The sky was clear, the air was fresh. All was good in the world. But through the woods a sound came, the sound of a thousand vicious Northmen. They charged out of the treeline, racing toward the Penguin Lord. The Penguin stood and watched them come, his stoic eyes considering each mortal man with sorrow and pity. He would have to fight them.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/uebs_13.jpg"/></p>, <p>The Vikings reached their foe and took their first swings, to no avail. They surrounded the Penguin and hacked and slashed and kicked and roared. But the Penguin Lord did not falter, he did not blink. He took the blows as a sponge takes water, and then he began his slow process. He turned in a circle and picked out his first victim. A single thrust, too fast for human eyes, and the human warrior fell in a shower of blood and fear. The Penguin circled again and slowly chose his next target. Again, the fearsome deathblow came. Was it a beak to the heart? Or a razor-like flipper through the neck? Nobody can say, such are the mysteries of the Immortal Gods.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/uebs_14.jpg"/></p>, <p>As night fell, so did men. But still the Vikings roared, still they fought bravely and without tiring. They fought long through the night, without rest and without remorse. The human spirit is indomitable, thought the Penguin sadly, as he plucked another warrior’s life away.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/uebs_15.jpg"/></p>, <p>The sun rose on the next day, and the Penguin Lord stood over his domain once more. But the precious white of his snow kingdom was polluted now, amassed with blood and bone, the corpses of the valiant Northmen lying in heaps around his tiny penguin feet. No survivors. He looked sadly into the blue sky, searching for some sign of peace from the heavens. Once again he had killed a generation of men who had come to hunt him. Once again, the emptiness of a friendless life filled him with a deep remorse. So stood the Penguin Lord of Nothing, King of the Wastes.

Every week we send Brendan onto the high seas of early access to see what booty he can plunder. This time, the maritime multiplayer mayhem of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/blackwake">Blackwake</a> [<a href="http://www.blackwake.com/">official site</a>].</i></p>, <p>Harrrr. Shiver my own timbers. <i>[Aside: </i><i>What else do pirates say?</i><i>]</i> Ahoy friendy! If you want to be a true-to-life sea dog just like me, the firey bosom of Blackwake awaits. It’s large-scale naval warfare with crews of up to 16 people. It’s what I’d call a ‘Hall-of-the-Mountain-King-like’, because that’s the royalty-free music that early access games often use <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/27/blackwake-multiplayer-naval-combat-game-on-steam-early-access/">in their trailer</a> to invoke a sense of chaos and silliness, a musical composition that has, as a result, become a coded signal for games which are roughewn and therefore “funny”.<span id="more-440665"></span></p>, <p>And Blackwake <em>can</em> be funny. When you’re walking along deck and you see your fellow sailor blown away in ragdoll glory by a distant and well-aimed cannon shot, it’s hard not to smile at their misfortune, even as you patch up the hole in the deck with your hammer. Even as you too are blasted away into the sea.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/PE_blackwake2.jpg"/></p>, <p>As a crewman, it’s your job to do something useful and follow your captain’s orders. They steer the ship, and you’re on red alert. Tasks range from loading and firing cannons, repairing hull damage or sail damage, pumping out water, restocking the cannon supplies, or taking potshots with your musket at enemy crewmen if they are close enough. Should the opportunity arise, you might try to board the enemy. In which case, it’s cutlasses and broken bottles at the ready, because the guns reload at the comically true-to-life pace of a 17<sup>th</sup> century weapon.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/PE_blackwake3.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are a few ship sizes, with the largest being a monstrous galleon packed with cannons below deck. There’s something impressive about looking down this line of guns and seeing a man stationed at each one, ready to fire on the captain’s orders. And there’s something claustrophobic about seeing the same place five minutes later through the blue blur of water as you all swim around trying to patch up the holes that are causing the massive hulk to sink. The battles normally feature three pirate ships versus three navy ships (although there is a 1v1 mode) with the winner being the first to diminish the enemy’s “tickets” in the style of ye olde Battlefield.</p>, <p>At it’s core, it’s a game of teamwork. Of following orders and making sure your manpower does not go to waste. Or, if you’ve successfully nominated yourself as the captain on arrival, a game of giving good orders and not suffering a mutiny (this is just a player-run vote that can happen at any time). It’s also wildly popular. There’s no trouble in finding a game. But there is trouble, for me, in finding a reason to stay once you’ve got the hang of it.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/PE_blackwake4.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s about repetition. I can see the appeal in having one job and doing it well. When you work side-by-side with everyone, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY1fUAPYH3M">sponger I and loader you</a>, you become a small component in a larger machine, ready to fulfill your duty come hell or high water (and the latter is a constant worry). It’s a part of what makes teamwork-based games good, what <a href="https://twitter.com/rxysurfchic/status/809949814788149248">someone once described</a> as the joy of videogames in it’s purest form – “being assigned a task and then completing that task”. But it’s also what keeps me from enjoying Blackwake as much as my crewmates. I can grab the powder and load the shot with the best of them. But after repeating the same tasks over and over, the fun is destined to dry up like a bone bleaching in the sun.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/PE_blackwake5.jpg"/></p>, <p>It feels like there is something missing from these naval skirmishes. Some essence or feature that can throw good teamwork or good captaincy into disarray. Efficiency is how you win the game, it’s what every captain is aiming for, but it’s also what makes the experience of being a sailor less interesting. There’s definitely a strategy to the battles, especially at the level of the cap’n. There are swivel guns that damage sails and slow your targets. There’s different types of shot to load into the cannons, some damaging hull and some damaging crew. There’s a grappling hook that can only be used if the captain gives a direct command to do so via the in-game orders. There’s a method to wearing down the enemy vessel and a method to breaking away from a dangerous chase. There’s good and bad weather that has a real impact on the fighting. When your ship gets rammed, the resulting bedlam is invariably hilarious.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/PE_blackwake6.jpg"/></p>, <p>But for all of this, it feels like there’s still a hole in the deck. Maybe some social element beyond a player-run vote, or some motive beyond running down the enemy’s tickets – possibly the least interesting competitive multiplayer design since the vanilla deathmatch. Whatever it is, right now I feel like being part of a well-lubed crew is less interesting than being part of a rowdy crowd of new players. Having a terrible captain who can’t cast off or doesn’t know port from starboard (it me) is funnier than having one who’ll give direct and perfect orders. It makes me vaguely sad that this incomplete leviathan has snuck out of the brine before the happier-looking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/sea-of-thieves/">Sea of Thieves</a>, a game which puts booty, not kills, at the centre of crew-on-crew competition.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/PE_blackwake7.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s also a game of two sides – the captain’s game is about being a good communicator and steering in a clever or lucky enough fashion to land a good broadside while taking little damage to their own vessel. The crew’s game is, well, just to do the same few tasks over and over while trying not to die. The endgame, if there is one, is to become a good captain. But if you don’t like barking orders and bossing people around, it’s not a position you can undertake with any usefulness, and you’ll – understandably – be booted right off the steering wheel.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/PE_blackwake8.jpg"/></p>, <p>There’s also a catch in terms of its design. Outside the captaincy, it has been built without any concrete roles. Every crewman can do every job. On paper that means that you can take a role and run with it all match. Become the ammo guy, delivering things to deck. Load all the cannons for everyone else, or man the sails and repair them if they become shot and ragged (a dangerous state to be in, since it slows your ship to a crawl). But in reality, every man really does every job. The captain shouts: “Right side, fire!” and everyone fires the… <em>[checks notes]</em> starboard guns. The captain shouts: “Repair the hull!” and everyone rushes to repair the hull. On a “good” ship there is no specialising or role-playing. In fairness, this fluidity often leads to a more able and efficient crew. But, like I say, that also means that well-fought battles turn out to be the most dull. The weight and clunkiness of your character, always getting caught on objects, and the lack of good “object signalling” and UI, are the types of early access rough edges that don’t help.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/PE_blackwake9.jpg"/></p>, <p>There’s teamwork and there’s strategy and there’s silliness here, for sure. But for a game about blowing your enemies away in a cloud of woody splinters, there’s an odd lack of excitement in it for me. This is where people normally yell “you need to play with friends!” but that’s the kind of industry fallacy I’ve always held in high suspicion. Playing with friends improves <i>every </i>videogame. I still suspect plenty of people will happily load cannons and fetch supplies even without crewmates of prior acquaintance. But for my doubloons, it currently feels like a throwaway distraction. An empty hulk, not a soul below.

Blackwood Crossing</a> [<a href="http://www.blackwoodcrossing.com/">official site</a>] is something truly beautiful, a wonderful vignette of joy and sadness, and it’s utterly throttled by its gruesome technical issues. It is testament to its delivery that despite this, despite playing it being akin to dragging a canoe through a lake of thick paste, and even despite the obviousness of where it was all heading, I still blubbed at the end.<span id="more-440331"></span></p>, <p>In Blackwood Crossing you play Scarlett, a young woman on a train, being taunted by her little brother Finn. He’s nipping about in a precocious red cape, his freckled face as obnoxious as any little brother’s should be. And clearly something is wrong.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/bla05.jpg"/></p>, <p>Unfortunately, before any of its superb delivery of intricately intertwined metaphors can be experienced, before I can celebrate what this game does so well, there’s a far bigger something wrong that smacks you hard in the face. It is utterly sodding terrible to <em>play</em>.</p>, <p>I rather outdid myself with “dragging a canoe through a lake of thick paste” and I’m not going to beat that. Whether using controller or mouse/keyboard, oh wow, it didn’t port properly, meaning moving both the camera and yourself is agonising. Gloopy, clumsy, and staggering all over the place, it falls far, far short of good enough for release. Further clues are given when you notice that the framerate is locked at 30FPS, and even so spends a good deal of the time in the high teens. I’ve scanned a few of the console reviews, and none of them mention the same issues, so I can only assume this is something that happened on the rugged road to PC. It really oughtn’t have been released yet – it’s kind of shitty that it was.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/bla06.jpg"/></p>, <p>It is so lavishly beautiful at times. In an early and extraordinary scene, one of the train’s carriages becomes suddenly blooms with grass, bushes, even a tree stretching up through the roof, all growing before you. As you walk through you emerge into an aureate greenhouse, magically somehow not on the train but set in a picturesque garden. Look back through the last doorway and you’ll see the countryside rushing past the windows of the compartment, but the view from in here is a static bucolic vista. Venturing back down the train, looking for some Polaroid photographs, I noticed the nearest seats the other side of the affected carriage have small patches of turf sprouting from them. Luxurious details. Buried alive.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/bla13.jpg"/></p>, <p>At another point Finn is directing you about a lakeside scene with the goal of finding papercraft items he’s created and hidden. As you hunt he gives perfectly enunciated “hotter” and “colder” variants, the hyperbolic “scorching!” “you’re melting!” “so freezing over there!” you should expect – nay demand – from a child. He delivers these directions hanging nonchalantly off some railings surrounding the bandstand on which he’s built his makeshift ‘base’. Feet tucked in on the lower metal bumps, arms out straight as he hangs backward. It’s such a precise and perfect observation of a child’s stature, so real and engaging, yet entirely unfussed over, possible to never notice if you don’t double-back and take a look at him – he’s moved by the time the task’s complete. These exquisite details are replete, each of them suffocated by the woefully broken controls.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/bla07.jpg"/></p>, <p>And on it goes. I want to celebrate the wonderful way it presents memories from Finn’s life, a cast of characters reappearing throughout the game’s few locations, sets constantly redressed to further reveal the nature of the memory in which you’re wandering, each character shown as an almost photo-realistic black and white (ever-so-slightly flickering) body, with a bright colourful paper mask covering their faces. How the train to which you keep returning seems so damned important, such a significant location with its lengthy stretches always so tightly confined. And the treehouse that impossibly grows from it. The details in that treehouse, the objects scattered across its shelves, the way it seems to change size, the looks Finn gives you as the two of you sit at the table therein, cutting hand-drawn butterflies from pieces of paper. And that character design. Seriously, it puts Pixar to shame. Just <em>wow</em>. All of these achievements sullied by being released in such a state.</p>, <p>So how it managed to affect me so strongly really is a recognition of just how well it delivers everything else. And it’s worth saying it really doesn’t offer any surprises. In fact, early on I thought to myself, “Oh come on, not this <em>again</em>“, desperately hoping it would be about to go somewhere genuinely unexpected. Then literally a couple of minutes later finding myself saying, out loud, “Oh shit, oh shit, oh shiiiiit”, as the completely expected happened and touched me anyway. As time went on, truthfully, I adjusted to the bloody dreadful controls. They didn’t become less bloody dreadful, and it never stopped being mindnumbing how slowly I moved, but you know how it is – your brain recalibrates and moves some sliders and you get on with it. As it hit its inevitable final beat, I blubbed on cue*. It worked.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/bla09.jpg"/></p>, <p>I dearly hope this receives a huge patch. Perhaps fistfuls of bandages and a full body cast. This could be a three-hour wonder, a really truly beautiful work to be lauded. Gosh I wish I could have written the review its unmangled form deserves. As it is, it’s very hard to recommend spending £12 on – already a tough call for such a short game. It’s not fit for purpose, even if it could still stretch over its unacceptable flaws and reach me. I will keep an eye out, and enthusiastically let you know should such a thing come about.

A Roman-themed arena combat game that rams home the point that rogueliteish characters are entirely disposable, <a href="https:/www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/domina/">Domina</a> [<a href="http://www.dominagame.com/">official site</a>] is all about feeding meat to the grinder in the name of keeping your precarious bloodsports empire afloat. Even if you somehow keep one of your fragile gladiators alive for long, chances are they’ll be begging for release from their horrific slavery before long anyway. A game of numbers as much as it is a game of death, it might just have a point to make if it weren’t also rubbing its hands together with salacious glee.<span id="more-440087"></span></p>, <p>A mutant pixel art affair, like the Delphine games of yore and as re-popularised by Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery, the slightly twisted anonymity of its characters suits Domina well. Everyone has a name, everyone has a happiness meter, but no-one actually matters. Blood for the blood god.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/55GqW-h6M3E?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>Though there’s roguelike DNA in there – keep your characters alive and with gradually improving abilities both by not dying in combat and by meeting basic needs – it’s also very much on the AdVenture Capitalist/Cookie Cruncher, etc. endless numbers side of management games. Which rather fits the Roman empire theme – lives toyed with and destroyed in the name of a few rich bastards’ opulence and entertainment. </p>, <p>Though you can individually manage training and morale, really Domina is set up to have such things be auto-managed by purchasing training ground upgrades to do it for you. You, meanwhile, focus on upgrading gladiator gear (itself a matter of frantic clicking until you run out cash) and choosing which of them you send out to have an increasingly low chance of surviving arena combat vs AI gladiators and the occasional furious lion or two. I don’t like lions, it turns out. Nasty habit of killing my men instantly, it turns out. Don’t bring a knife to a lion fight, say I.</p>, <p>You can, if you wish, control your gladiators directly for a spot of high-speed clicky-stabby with a side-order of basic dodging, though as a campaign wears on (presuming it doesn’t end in ignominy early on, which is often the case) this can become even more lethal than allowing the AI to handle them. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/domina1.jpg"/></p>, <p>What I really like is that there’s a choice – you can even specify a fighter’s training focus on their aptitude when under AI control, instead of, say, agility, strength, defence or weapon capability. The smart way to play is to create specialists, picking who best to send out against an enemy with a weakness in one discipline or another, but equally it can all be auto-managed if you’re feeling overwhelmed.</p>, <p>Most of the time, you’re spending your winnings on buying new gear, picking team-wide new skills or building upgrades while Domina unstoppably ticks through in-game days until the next fight. Everyone needs to be kept fed and watered too, so running out of cash is potentially lethal – even you, as the gladiators’ silent, cash-strapped owner, can starve or thirst to death. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/domina2.jpg"/></p>, <p>Also in the mix is keeping a couple of opposing officials happy via a combination of wine-based bribery and occasional make-a-choice text pop-ups, in order that they might cover some of your costs or sell you new flesh for the endless sausage-making-machine. A fair few other elements too, like recruiting NPCs to auto-heal or selecting which ‘blessings’ to apply to your fighters, but really the meat of the game is training up guys then praying they don’t die, leaving you with a handful of rookies. It’s a bit like XCOM in that regard, but with more leather jockstraps.</p>, <p>As the game escalates from one-on-one battles to e.g. teams of eight vs. eight and semi-optional boss fights against ultra-gladiators, near-total wipe-outs are eminently possible, and indeed occur with brutal speed. Between that and cash/food/water/morale, it’s one of those games you should expect to completely fail most times you play – and often you won’t see it coming.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/domina4.jpg"/></p>, <p>This is the design. In fact, so determined is Domina that it’s a done-in-a-session affair that it currently lacks any kind of save feature, including the now-traditional ‘save and exit.’ Quit and you’ll lose all progress – because the idea is that you’ll never make more than an hour or two of progress anyway. This is about doing the same thing time and again to see how far you can get via a mix of chance and decision-making. It has Twitch interaction built-in – it’s one of those sorts of games. </p>, <p>I appreciate the intent, and admittedly it doesn’t take long to get back up to speed in a new campaign, but sadly it conflicts with the reality that none of us can guarantee a certain amount of time, and knowing that you’ll lose everything if you’re called away unexpectedly or your damn cat stands on your PC’s power button yet again rankles. The Binding of Isaac has save and quit, y’know (other than in daily runs)? So I’ll be surprised if it doesn’t end up being patched in here too.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/domina5.jpg"/></p>, <p>The other fly in an otherwise enjoyable if rather transitory enjoyment is that Domina is swaddled in extremely sweary voiceover. It’s trying to be comic, but most of its gags don’t go further than ‘man says a naughty word.’ It’s clearly playing to the gallery, and there’s again a certain thematic appropriateness here given that gladiatorial events weren’t exactly renowned for their decorum, but it’s neither edgy or offensive – just repetitive and tiresome. </p>, <p>Fortunately, Domina as a game isn’t. It has quite a few moving parts, but each part is very simple. It really is oddly similar to one of those keep-clicking-the-numbers games, but pinned with a more meaningful structure and shallow but engagingly frantic combat. Throughout, I was conscious that I was playing something that was almost aggressively designed to be disposable, and for that reason I can’t say it feels close to my heart – but at the same time, I might just keep it hanging around my hard drive to fill idle half-hours now and again. 

Utopia is the first major expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/stellaris/">Stellaris</a>, Paradox Development Studio’s 4X, grand strategy space hydra. It’s a term that normally conjures up images of a perfect society, all green and chill and maybe a little like Star Trek’s United Federation of Planets. That’s nice, I guess, but what if your idea of perfection is building a civilization on the backs of robotic slaves? And what about a monstrous hive of ravenous beasties that won’t rest until all matter in the universe has been consumed? What would its utopia look like? I’ve been experimenting with a galaxy-sized petri dish to find out. <span id="more-439993"></span></p>, <p>You don’t need to get very far into Stellaris to see the impact of Utopia and its accompanying free patch, titled Banks. The moment you enter your species-creating laboratory, things should immediately look pretty different. </p>, <p><img src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/utopia2.jpg"/></p>, <p>Crafting a government now involves picking components from three distinct lists: ethics, authority and civics. Ethics aren’t entirely new, but there are a couple of replacements – egalitarianism and authoritarianism – that change the statistical bonuses found within the concentric circles that help define your society. Your picks then inform what type of governments your newly-spawned civilisation can construct by selecting an authority, like democratic or imperial, and then civics. The latter is a meaty list from which you can choose two civics, running the gamut from shadow council, conferring a 50 percent bonus to influencing elections, to mechanist, which gives you droids to play with right from the get go. </p>, <p>I’ve got a penchant for making techy, nerdy aliens with a hard-on for robots, but until Utopia, a lot of that had to be just in my head. Sure, I could invest in more research facilities and eventually make a breakthrough that allowed me to build automatons, but any species can do that. In Utopia, there are considerably more ways to make my eggheads stand out. It’s possible to start developing a society of machines from day one, and with other civics, small but important boosts to research make it clear to everyone in the galaxy: these lab coats ain’t just for show.</p>, <p><img src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/utopia3.jpg"/></p>, <p>This extra fine-tuning leads to a greater sense of control, and that feeling that you’re able to better determine the direction of your species extends well beyond the species creator, notably thanks to traditions. These are, essentially, Stellaris’ very own version of national focuses, which you might be familiar with if you’ve dabbled in Paradox’s flagship grand strategy game, Europa Universalis. </p>, <p>By spending a new resource, unity, trees can be unlocked, each containing five bonuses themed around a specific ideology, of which there are seven. Reducing unrest, lowering ship costs, unlocking new types of colony ships – traditions affect every aspect of Stellaris while also providing empires with a more distinct identity. They also ensure that progression feels constant. Even when you’re well into the end-game, development persists.</p>, <p><img src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/utopia4.jpg"/></p>, <p>The real benefit of the tradition system takes a bit of time to reveal itself, however. See, once you’ve unlocked all five of them in a single tree, you can choose an ascension perk, and this is where Paradox have gone all out in creating the fantasy of leading a highly advanced, space-faring empire. Some of the perks confer massive bonuses, like the world shaper’s 100 percent increase in terraforming speed. But the ones you’ll really want to play around with have an even more tangible impact. Synthetic evolution turns your entire species into robots. Transcendence makes everyone telepathic. And there are three different perks that let you construct fancy sci-fi megastructures like space habitats, Dyson spheres and, yes, finally, ringworlds. </p>, <p>It takes a significant amount of time to access these game-changing perks, and then even more time, resources and research to implement them. You won’t be turning your population into machines or consuming every planet in a solar system to create a massive ringworld right away, but the early-game is already busy enough as it is. What they do is highlight possible directions, nudging empires down different, logical paths with massive rewards waiting for you once you’ve put in the time. </p>, <p><img src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/utopia5.jpg"/></p>, <p>Synthetic Evolution doesn’t just make everyone robots – it means that you can happily colonise any potentially habitable planet regardless of the biome. Oh yeah, and everyone becomes immortal. Conveniently, robots don’t eat, either, so it’s no longer necessary to worry about food production, at least not for your synthetic citizens. Priorities change, then, and new avenues open up, blessing the later parts of Stellaris with the novelty and sense of discovery that was previously more evident in the earlier exploration and colonisation phase.</p>, <p>If expansion and developing new colonies are what you crave the most, you don’t need to stop, either. Even once you’ve exhausted every colonisable planet, it’s possible to continue growing your vast space empire through habitats, which can orbit most worlds, creating more room in which a multitude of citizens can be crammed, along with plenty of resource-generating buildings. Ringworlds, meanwhile, can turn unappealing solar systems into megastructures that are effectively four Gaia-class planets all rolled into one gargantuan building encircling a sun. </p>, <p><img src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/utopia6.jpg"/></p>, <p>Despite the aforementioned constant progression, the benefits of traditions can threaten to become a little redundant, and while the purpose they serve is an important one, forcing players to unlock an entire tree to get a perk strips away some flexibility. </p>, <p>Take the journey of my space nerds, for instance. I started by focusing on the discovery tree, with its myriad bonuses to exploration and science, which made complete sense for my friendly species of scientists who liked mathematics more than conquest. With that tree complete, I selected the perk that gave me a 10 percent buff to research. I was doing a lot of building and working on a beefy fleet, so the prosperity tree was a natural next step, and once that was complete, I turned everyone into a cyborg. As you do. But by the time I’d gone down yet another tree and finally created a perfect synthetic species, I found myself a bit stumped. I had both the time and inclination to get several new perks, but none of the trees really seemed relevant to either the theme of my empire or my needs. So I was going through the motions, unlocking more unnecessary traditions just so I could get to the good stuff. </p>, <p><img src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/utopia7.jpg"/></p>, <p>More choices would certainly help, but the real problem is the rule that you must work your way through every single tradition in a tree before getting access to a new perk. That Stellaris makes so many playstyles and paths viable – normally a boon – becomes an issue here because inevitably you’re going to have to spend a vast amount of unity on things that simply don’t matter to you. </p>, <p>While this system attempts – and sometimes succeeds – to solve the problem where, once you’ve build the foundations of your empire, there’s a lot of waiting around for interesting things to happen, it can sometimes exacerbate it. It is not, however, alone, and is joined in its effort by a reworked faction system. Previously, factions were effectively just rebellious groups of dissidents, but now they can represent political parties or large movements, like religious groups railing against a secular empire. And they don’t all exist in opposition to the establishment. They might fully support it. This depends on their values and objectives, and if they’re being catered to. </p>, <p><img src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/utopia8.jpg"/></p>, <p>Factions can be managed indirectly by studying their values and then attempting to pander to them. If a faction demanding better treatment for aliens is getting a bit upset, maybe consider not enslaving every new species you meet? But there are also direct actions you can take by suppressing them, promoting their ideology, or fully embracing them, potentially changing the ethics of your society. Ignoring them increases the chances of creating unrest, as citizens become unhappy, which can lead to riots, terrorism and schisms within the empire. This adds continuous agency and personality to populations while making engaging with them considerably more compelling than simply dealing with angry rebels, and importantly it’s clear how you can solve any problems that they might create. </p>, <p>But you know who doesn’t care about factions? Hive Minds. By picking the Hive Mind ethic when you create your species, you get a unique authority separate from the other political systems and your own set of civics that make your rather disturbing new species completely distinct. Hive Minds don’t suffer from unhappiness, they don’t create factions, they consume any aliens that live inside their empires, and any member of the Hive Mind that leaves will eventually die. </p>, <p><img src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/utopia9.jpg"/></p>, <p>The impact of playing a Hive Mind seeps into almost every element of Stellaris, sometimes in minor ways, but frequently major ones. How you approach expansion or dealing with other species is dramatically different. And there’s a certain appeal in playing an organic machine that feeds on other lifeforms and doesn’t give two hoots about comfort or happiness. In a Hive Mind’s utopia, everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals. But playing as this single-minded tyrant also means forgoing some of Stellaris’ best new features, like the increasingly complex political game and population management. If you need a break from intensive micromanagement, however, then Hive Minds may prove to be a seductive prospect. </p>, <p>Utopia and the accompanying free update fix a great many niggles found within Stellaris. Storytelling and discovery have always been the game’s strong points, while empire management and politics could sometimes feel a bit underwhelming, especially when things start to slow down by the middle of the game. While not every issue is solved, great strides have been made towards maintaining the game’s pace from the start, fleshing out populations and generally making the galaxy feel even more alive and more diverse. </p>, <p>However! Factions, most civics, traditions, the reworked government system and a multitude of other tweaks and improvements are all available for free with the Banks patch. Utopia enhances them, adding the more advanced civics, ascension perks and megastructures, but it’s really just building on the excellent foundations created by the update. These enhancements are great, sometimes even game-changing, but Paradox are offering so much for free that it makes the actual premium DLC less vital.

What a peculiar thing is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/Bulletstorm:-Full-Clip-Edition/">Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition</a> [<a href="http://bulletstorm.com/">official site</a>]. It’s Bulletstorm from six years ago, that entertaining FPS, but this time with an optional additional mode that is loads worse. That’ll be full price, please!<span id="more-439563"></span></p>, <p>Bulletstorm rather inexplicably didn’t sell well. It was a big budget FPS that tossed aside all the bullshit bathos that polluted the genre then and now, focusing on gore, explosions and naughty swears. Competent, well written (comic guru Rick Remender wrote the dumb-but-smart script), and incessantly bombastic, it completely delivered. It should have been a hit. People Can Fly managed to be boorish without being vile. But modest sales were not enough to convince the bossmen it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/04/11/rip-waggleton-p-tallylicker-bulletstorm-2-canceled/">worth persisting</a> with a sequel. Oh, and the PC version was gruesomely strangled by GFWL at the time, which certainly didn’t help matters.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/stor03.jpg"/></p>, <p>It has been, they say, visually upgraded, 4K resolutions added, and I’ll assume that’s true. The original version is gone from the inter-shops (owned by EA, it’s not even on Origin), so I can’t really compare. I remember that it looked extremely pretty back then, and it looks extremely pretty now (outside of cutscenes, that look bizarrely awful), so that likely means it’s been much upgraded. Six year old pretty tends to look pretty crummy in the present, and this certainly doesn’t. Although close-ups of faces reveal the passage of time, and some textures are pretty cruddy, the vistas remain breathtaking. Saying that, looking at old screenshots it’s hard to tell the difference, but this more stands as testament to how damned good it looked back then.</p>, <p>You don’t need me to review Bulletstorm again. I really enjoy it, despite its being a corridor shooter – it gets the constricted genre exactly right, allowing inventive, improvised combat within its narrow walls, charging from ridiculous set-piece to more ridiculous set-piece without pause, and it does it well. You can read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/02/22/bulletstorm-review-pc/">Quintin’s original review</a>, our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/08/the-rps-verdict-bulletstorm/">group verdict</a> of the game, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/11/23/have-you-played-bulletstorm/">Alice’s more recent reflections</a> on the fun it offered. We really like the original Bulletstorm, present here, and we haven’t changed our minds. It’s great, you can’t buy the original any more, and so if you never did you should.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/stor02.jpg"/></p>, <p>So now it’s back, olden DLC included, and with new DLC that, oh, replaces the central character with Duke Nukem. Oh.</p>, <p>What a weird decision. It’s like re-releasing Bladerunner but replacing Harrison Ford with Mel Gibson. True Lies, but with Arnie’s role portrayed by Dane Cook. The Wicker Man, but Edward Woodward usurped by Nicolas Cage – oh wait. It’s so madly out of touch with reality, a decision made by a boardroom so isolated from actual air-breathing humans that they think Duke Nukem is anything other than a weary punchline. And, naturally, the results are a disaster.</p>, <p>Of course this is an optional mode, offered as a pre-order bonus or separate DLC, but if you played the original then it’s really the only new content available. And wow, it’s shoddy. It’s a straight replacement of former hero Grayson Hunt with the ever-dreary Duke, with all “original” dialogue from the flat-topped anti-hero. And only him. Leading to the incessant farce that his hastily bashed out lines absolutely do not fit in to the game, clashing amateurishly with the original dialogue spoken by the rest of the cast. And yes, I scarequote “original”, because it’s as fresh as Duke’s lines ever were. (Those old enough to have enjoyed Duke Nukem 3D will recall his most famous lines just happened to have been previously uttered by the likes of They Live and Evil Dead.)</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/stor06.jpg"/></p>, <p>Now, had this been handled with flare and grace it could have been pretty funny. Alas. Duke fairly early on gives up correcting people who call him Gray, and instead just says tired, “borrowed” action dialogue that doesn’t quite match up with the conversation around him. Occasionally it rather desperately resorts to Duke’s saying pretty much the same line as the original in order for there to be any sense, and this always entirely contradicts the rest of his character. It feels clumsy, so much so that when it then tries to be self-referential about this, it feels more like it’s laughing at you for having paid than itself for having failed.</p>, <p>Worst of all, so haphazardly has the replacement been done that Duke uses all the same animations as Gray – it is, really, no more than a reskinning – and this becomes problematic when it comes to the lip-sync. Which is – obviously – ludicrous as a result. Duke’s mouth moves while he’s silent, stays still while he’s talking, and if the two happen to line up, clearly don’t match. It’s pretty surprisingly shoddy stuff. And Jon St. John’s delivery is as bad as I’ve ever heard.</p>, <p>And so pointless! It’s not like Gray was a mild-mannered accountant to be amusingly contrasted by the crass and foul-mouthed Duke. Gray’s typical dialogue consisted of lines like, “You scared the dick off me!” He already was a far, far more entertaining and well-written character in the same mold as Gearbox’s long-loathed license. It reeks of desperation.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/stor07.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are six more Echoes maps for the single-player speed runs/high score tasks, although I’m not sure if that extends to the much more fun Ultimate Echoes challenge modes. They don’t say, and my memory isn’t that good. It also offers the splendid-sounding Overkill Campaign mode, with all weapons and Skill Shots unlocked from the start, which sounds like it would be tremendous fun. Would be, because for no good reason it’s not available from the start, isn’t mentioned anywhere by the game, and will only appear once you’ve completed the game. Hey, guess what? I completed the game six years ago. Sigh. It certainly doesn’t help that the game’s marketing info doesn’t mention this is locked.</p>, <p>So it’s an odd bag, really. Bulletstorm is lots of silly fun, and deserved to do better in 2011. It’s still lots of silly fun, but it’s hard to quite get as behind the desire for it to do well when it’s being released at full price with very little new put in. Refreshed graphics, 4K support, increased polygons you absolutely won’t appreciate unless you’ve got a video mode on your photographic memory – that’s the sort of thing you’d hope to see in a patch. It’s great that it’s in there, and the game unquestionably looks lovely – I’ve obviously no idea how much of a slog it was to achieve this. But when new modes are restricted to a few more Echoes maps, and even the shitty Duke mode is a separate piece of DLC for those who didn’t pre-order (which is everyone, <em><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/03/18/editorial-lets-not-pre-order-games-any-more-eh/">right</a></em>?), it’s not a bedazzling offer. Not least when the new game plus mode is locked, despite your having finished the game over half a decade ago.</p>, <p>At a budget price reflecting the age of the game and the lack of new content, this would be such an easy recommendation. Especially as I could so easily recommend you not waste your money on the cruddy half-arsed Duke DLC mode. At £30 that’s a tougher call for you to make.

Every week we send Brendan to investigate the seedy underworld of early access. This time, interrogating the robots of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/bot-colony/">Bot Colony</a> [<a href="https://www.botcolony.com/">official site</a>].</i></p>, <p>Bot Colony, according to its own boast, is “the first video game featuring intelligent conversation as its key gameplay feature”. You speak into a microphone and ask questions of the robot characters, or give them commands. You might remember Chris attempting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/07/07/bot-colony-alpha-review/">put books on shelves</a> using this voice recognition feature. You might also remember him failing miserably. Well, it’s been some time since then and we thought we’d give it another shot in this video special. Read on and watch my own doomed attempt to communicate with mankind’s newest mistake.<span id="more-439327"></span></p>, <p>This time, the robot has the added challenge of interpreting a Celtic accent, a task at which voice recognition is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAz_UvnUeuU">famously terrible</a>. I am used to changing my vowels into a mock English for the benefit of confused administration staff who don’t understand when I say that I was born in “aidy-aid”. And there is definitely some of that here. But I was not prepared for the level of misunderstanding these robots would have at the words “name” or “who” and their lack of comprehension of individual letters of the alphabet. At the bottom of the screen you can see where my words were interpreted.</p>, <p>This is supposed to be a training sequence, the first of three planned missions but I sadly would not get any further. The robot has witnessed a break-in. A spy has stolen an important piece of tech (an advanced sensor) from a Japanese scientist’s home. You need to question the bot and piece together the exact order of events through its responses. Sometimes you get video records of what the bot has seen, but often he will just rattle off some facts in a hugely specific fashion. The robot’s name is Jimmy. He is the worst domestic robot I have ever met.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v5Zs3n1hWkw" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>As you can see the interrogation was almost entirely fruitless. Voice recognition and AI responses are not really at a stage when you can have an “intelligent conversation” with a machine, no matter what the game’s blurb might say. Even Alexa and Siri fall to pieces under pressure. However, the experience of repeating the word “who” into a microphone countless times has made me sympathise for all future homicide detectives who bring in a robotic witness. It’s true that you can edit the phrase you’re saying in the typebox, or just type all your questions from the start. But that kinda defeats the purpose and appeal of the game. It’s a mystery about chatting to robots, not texting them.</p>, <p>I’m not sure what the thinking was behind having so many Japanese names in the story, either. Surely an English-language machine would be more comfortable with ‘John’ or ‘Sarah’, rather than ‘Masaya’ and ‘Ayame’ (no matter what demands the plot has)? And surely the player, more likely to be English-speaking than Japanese-speaking, would be equally glad of simple, recognisable names in a conversation that requires clarity. It’s just one of the world’s details that feels counterproductive.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/PE_botcolony1.jpg"/></p>, <p>Before you begin, Windows sets up your voice recognition. You have to speak certain lines into the microphone as part of a voice test that lasts about fifteen minutes, much of it instructions on how to treat the robot (instructions which hint at the low level of cognition your robot is really going to have). But seeing that one test was clearly not enough, I exited out and tried to give the machine more to work with. That’s when you see me bumping out to desktop, whereupon I read out the game’s convoluted back story in my best storytime voice and hoped that it would be enough. It was not enough.</p>, <p>I’m sure this is working more confidently for some than for myself. Aside from the <em>accent issue</em>, more voice tests are supposed to lead to better results. But each test takes a long time and there’s no guarantee that three or four or five tests will make the interpreter as clever as it would need to be to follow directions that are more complex than “pick up X” or “walk forwards two metres”. I also realised with hindsight that many words are probably saved in the robots thick skull as American. So when I said, “turn on the tap”, I really ought to have said “turn on the faucet”. Although there is the added trouble of not knowing which objects in the house can be interacted with and which are purely environmental. It’s all very messy.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/apr/PE_botcolony3.jpg"/></p>, <p>The truth is, I went in knowing that it would be janky. But I didn’t expect it to be <em>this</em> janky. And I wanted to be surprised at the machine’s awareness. This comes across sometimes, when you insult it, for instance, and it detects the hostility (sorry, Jimmy). But mostly the game is a victim of a multi-layered problem. First, the voice recognition can be laughable. Second, the robot’s interpretation of your questions and commands is as overly strict and non-malleable as you’d expect. Third, the actual “game” itself doesn’t help matters. Trying to collect video recordings isn’t very exciting and putting pieces of furniture back into their pre-thievery positions is no more fun than when you played ‘spot the difference’ on the back of your Honey Cheerios box.</p>, <p>No. It is a game wholly reliant and marketed on its technology, which feels so much more absurd the more you attempt to communicate with the machine. I suspect it will be better for people with hours of voice recognition testing behind them (not to mention the exact accent the robot was designed for), and there is also an element of learning the right commands and sticking to that cheatsheet of robot lines. It’s also admirable, from a technology perspective, to pursue projects like this. The ideal – to talk to a robot and have it understand you – is one worth chasing. But with a learning process as daft as this, I couldn’t face going through it all when the story and surrounding tasks are so wafer thin. That, and Jimmy really, <em>really</em> annoyed me.

Yooka-Laylee, the crowdfunded colourful 3D platformer, is essentially a sequel to Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie just wearing different pyjamas. Where Nuts &amp; Bolts took the franchise in a slightly different direction, Yooka-Laylee is an unapologetic return to the N64 formula of cheeky humour, bright playgrounds and collectibles coming out the wazoo. Playing it is like discovering there’s an episode of a favourite TV show you somehow missed at the time. Here’s Wot I Think:<span id="more-437835"></span></p>, <p>Yooka-Laylee is actually a buddy game where chamaeleon (Yooka) and bat (Laylee) are searching for a book stolen by the villainous bee, Capital B. Capital B is using a sort of global literature vacuum to suck books into his keeping and… I think he’s looking to use the golden pages from Yooka-Laylee’s book in particular to finish off a gold statue of himself? It seems so long ago now that all of that was explained. </p>, <p>What you are mostly doing isn’t really narrative-based, though. You open up worlds, collect Pagies (those golden pages) by performing tasks or completing minigames within the worlds and then use those Pagies to open up more worlds or to expand the content of the ones you’ve already found until you finally reach your showdown with Capital B.</p>, <p><img alt="Yooka-Laylee" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/yooka15.jpg"/></p>, <p>Along the way you collect all manner of other bits and pieces – golden quills are a currency you use to unlock new special moves from a snake named Trowzer, ghost writers are these little coloured spirits which can be captured in particular conditions, other doodads will extend your life and so on and so on. You’ll also learn to shoot fire, ice, grenades, water as well as ingesting objects to take on their properties – cannonballs will make you heavier and stop you being blown away in windy areas. If you know the N64 games you’ll be able to mentally swap out Jinjos and Jiggies for most of the new vernacular. </p>, <p>Similarly, there’s Dr Puzz who offers to transform you into planes or boats or plants or whatnot if you’ll find the Molly Cule hidden in each world. She’s this game’s version of Mumbo Jumbo or Humba Wumba in the original and I’m glad they opted for this approach rather than trying to do anything with shamanism again. That’s one aspect of the older games I find myself wincing at even though I didn’t notice it as a kid. </p>, <p><img alt="Yooka-Laylee" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/yooka7.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s a testament to both the enduring appeal of Banjo-Kazooie and the faithful nature of the sequel that at some point I gave up calling it Yooka-Laylee and just started referring to the game as “Banjo-Kazoodle” as I used to when I was younger. You can probably also get a sense for how much Banjo-Kazoodle I played on the N64 and how successfully Yooka-Laylee recreates that mindset by the fact I kept accidentally trying to perform old moves like the Beak Barge and Bill Drill to solve problems. It’s like falling through a dimensional rift and playing an old favourite – familiar but different.</p>, <p>An interesting facet of this revival is that it recreates those old games for better and for worse. </p>, <p>I was delighted to see colourful Rare-esque landscapes again and read that familiar style of dialogue – teasing but not mean-spirited and with a bundle of innuendo thrown in. Properly delighted. I don’t think I’d realised how uncommon it was now or thought anyone would even try to bring it back. </p>, <p><img alt="Yooka-Laylee" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/yooka1.jpg"/></p>, <p>I liked the manageable chunks of gaming you get in dividing things up into these minigames and I liked the way that the whole thing is geared around a manageable number of collectibles so the experience doesn’t spiral off into a tedious Ubi-esque collectathon strapped to a narrative. Collecting is the point of the game rather than the thing designed to compel you to clean up a map and stay in the game longer than you really want. </p>, <p>They’ve also done something good with the underwater segments. Underwater is generally the bane of my life in this kind of game but there’s a special move that lets you encase yourself in a bubble and thus run around underwater as if it’s on land. I was embarrassingly grateful for NOT having to swim if I didn’t want to. </p>, <p><img alt="Yooka-Laylee" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/yooka20.jpg"/></p>, <p>The other pleasing thing is the expansion you unlock for the worlds. It’s a nice halfway house between Banjo-Kazooie, which had relatively small worlds, and Banjo-Tooie whose sprawl was genuinely impressive but also overwhelming. You start off with the basic version of the world and then collect enough Pagies to expand the book. That adds extra buildings/challenges/pathways… and so you go back in having got the lay of the land and start exploring the new bits.</p>, <p>On the less impressive side, there are a bunch of niggles. The most persistent of them is the camera. The camera angles are exactly as awkward and unhelpful at times as they were in the original. You go through a doorway and the camera is often facing you so the first thing you have to do is reverse your directions for a few moments while you re-orient yourself. If you’re on a section where the devs have decided a top-down camera is more useful it can be a right pain transitioning out of that – you go to leave, leaving switches to a new camera angle, the direction you’re heading becomes something different in relation to the new camera angle and you run back into the top-down view. Those are the most obvious issues but you’ll encounter camera wrestling at various points throughout. </p>, <p><img alt="Yooka-Laylee" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/yooka24.jpg"/></p>, <p>Flying is a pain in the bum, too. It’s the new swimming. It can be really hard to tell where you are in 3D space, plus you also get a bunch of unhelpful camera angles as part of being airborne. There are also niggles like pulling back on the analogue stick (I will only play this on controller) generally meaning you want to go backwards but when flying it means you descend so turning is the most awkward thing. Oh, and through flying you’ll find ledges and platforms it looks like you should be able to land on, then reach them only to discover they’re invisible walls. Invisible walls are awful. </p>, <p>Some of the minigames really outstay their welcome, too. There are races you compete in with a little cloud and they just go on far too long, especially for the speed you’re travelling at. If you don’t complete them first or second time they become a truly boring slog. Same with the minecart races and the retro arcade games – I’d enjoy them if they were half the length but they just end up feeling bloated. </p>, <p><img alt="Yooka-Laylee" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/yooka3.jpg"/></p>, <p>I should add that Yooka-Laylee continues the grand tradition of not believing in maps. It shows you things you’ve unlocked in relation to other things by zooming out from them with a cut scene/shot. But when you’re shown a lot of stuff (in the case of expanding a world, for example) it’s really difficult to keep track of what’s just happened. You can also lose your bearings if you unlock multiple new areas when in a different form. I was pottering round as a little ship and I blasted my way through several obstacles to open up new areas all in one go so I didn’t have to go through the palaver of transforming multiple times, and then wasn’t sure if I’d actually managed to find them all again in my regular form. </p>, <p>One final gripe is that the boss fights are dull. They’re the familiar rinse and repeat of doing a thing until the boss gets cranky, then doing variations on that thing until you defeat them. I actually enjoyed meeting them because their characters were generally amusing in that first instance, but going through the intro dialogue multiple times quickly lost any charm it once had. Same for the fights themselves. </p>, <p>The final boss fight is the dullest of the bunch which is a shame as at least the others aren’t mandatory for finishing the game. It both outstays its welcome by a long shot and fails to do anything interesting with the mechanics of fighting. You just run through an overlong set of repetitions of the various moves until you get to the next section of the fight. Unskippable cut scenes partway through, dialogue you can’t speed through, no checkpointing, no health refresh options, no kind of acknowledgement that you’ve mastered any of the components… these all come together to make defeating Capital B a slog which soured the end of the experience considerably. </p>, <p><img alt="Yooka-Laylee" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/yooka9.jpg"/></p>, <p>This is the interesting part, for me. Not the part where I’m playing the game and being irritated by those things, but how inextricably linked to the whole experience they are. I’ve never had particularly rose-tinted specs for games I loved as a kid, I don’t think. I’m fond of them, but I also remember how cross these boss fights made me and how fed up I’d get not being able to make a jump or find a thing or get my bearings when swimming or flying or having to repeat a race for the umpteenth time. So when you make a game like Yooka-Laylee where you want to recreate the feeling of playing something like Banjo-Kazoodle what do you do?</p>, <p>If you strip out the annoying parts or rework them do you lose something crucial about the experience of the game as a whole? I think there are corrections that would be easy to make without disrupting the flow or the whole. Things like shortening those aforementioned races, or cutting out the intro dialogue from boss fights. The change to underwater movement was also welcome without feeling unfaithful. </p>, <p><img alt="Yooka-Laylee" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/yooka22.jpg"/></p>, <p>Maps are a little more awkward because they involve adding a UI element that wasn’t present in the original as well changing the way you approach navigation. Generally the games trade in you seeing something interesting and heading towards it, or seeing a bunch of uncollected golden quills and knowing you haven’t been to that area yet. A map would remove that, but would also help guard against the feeling of wandering aimlessly which can set in when you’ve collected the obvious <del datetime="2017-03-28T11:21:44+00:00">Jiggies</del> Pagies and are trying to find out what’s left. </p>, <p>This is perhaps what the tonic system is trying to help with. Tonics are things you unlock by meeting various targets like stunning a certain number of enemies or collecting a number of ghost writers. You are allowed to equip one at a time and they do things like make your power bar fill up faster. One tonic helps you find collectibles so you equip it and if you go near a hidden extra you’ll get notified with some more game sounds. It doesn’t get rid of the aimless wandering, but it can reduce it a bit. </p>, <p><img alt="Yooka-Laylee" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/yooka13.jpg"/></p>, <p>I’m aware that I’ve spent a lot of time talking about the things which frustrate me, but I want to make sure I say that I’ve been having a lovely time. It doesn’t quite get back the magic of the originals – the expansion system means it lacks the diversity of worlds for one thing, and for another you can’t recreate that nineties wonder of me feeling like “this is the biggest game I’ve ever seen!” when I’ve played Minecraft or Skyrim or DayZ or anything else in the intervening years – but it brings enough of what I loved about the older incarnations that I willingly binged on it over the weekend where usually I keep those days free from work tasks. </p>, <p>I’m far less sure of how someone without that attachment to the originals will perceive the mix of flaws and strengths. For me the chance to revisit one of my first game infatuations did reduce the annoyances, or at least they became part and parcel of going back – you take the irritants with the joys because without it it wouldn’t be the same. </p>, <p>But I want to end by highlighting that this is a friendly game regardless of whether you had an N64 two decades ago. That feels like a valuable commodity at this point in time. Yooka-Laylee is bright, it’s positive, it’s daft and it wants to play with you. And that’s lovely.

If there’s one thing I’m sick of, it means I’ve had some sort of head injury and forgotten the many, many, copious things I’m also sick of. But amongst their number is the cavalcade of recent games that feel the need to try to trick me into learning computer programming. You know, I’m good thanks. I’m 40 this year, my brain has pretty much established over multiple attempts that it just isn’t willing to let in computer programming, along with French, the difference between “affect” and “effect” <em>[not to mention “defuse” and “diffuse” -ed.]</em>, and the HTML for embedding an email address. You program the games, I’ll play them. Ta.</p>, <p>Anyway, so there’s a nice new puzzle game out called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/bomb-squad-academy/">Bomb Squad Academy</a> [<a href="http://bombsquad.academy/">official site</a>], a game about defusing bombs against the clock, and – WAIT A SECOND! This game’s teaching me <em>electronics</em>! Why I oughtta…<span id="more-438343"></span></p>, <p>And it does it really rather well.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/bom3.jpg"/></p>, <p>The key difference here, from my mini-rant above, is that this isn’t pretending to be something it’s not. It’s not a platform game where you weirdly have to keep running through OR gates. Bomb Squad Academy is very unashamedly about teaching the basics of electronics, and the crucial thing is, it’s managed to make that process immediately applied, and decent fun. As I play through its relatively simple challenges, I just keep thinking, “Good grief, if only I could have had this in 1994 instead of a tired physics teacher and some clapped out electronics boards.”</p>, <p>Approach it as an educational tool, rather than the latest in puzzle gaming innovation, and it does its job splendidly. The game is, in effect, one long tutorial, each new level adding in a new component (best pun I’ve ever used) like wiring, capacitors, XOR gates, and so on. But what’s so crucial is that it’s instantly applied.</p>, <p>I think the main reason all these basics went over my head at school was that so much was taught as floating theory, pencil-drawn circuit diagrams and faith. The theory of AND, OR and XOR gates are simple enough, but if you want to truly learn something, have it embed in your cranium, you need to apply it. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/bom1.jpg"/></p>, <p>What better application than pretending if you make a mistake you’ll die. You’re disabling bombs, and that involves studying the circuit board, looking what’s powering what, and working out a way to send power from the source to the LEDS marked “Disarm”. Except without accidentally powering up “Detonate”. That leads to a rather big bang, and a message informing you of your demise. With its digital countdowns, there’s always plenty of time to solve a puzzle, but limiting you to a minute or two ensures there’s a degree of pressure. (Sensibly there’s an option to make these times much longer, for any who might need that.) When the boards start getting a lot more complex, it requires a deliberate effort to stay calm, do the diligent work, and not just panic and cut wires at random. Because when you do make a mistake, the explosion is instantaneous and makes me jump every single time.</p>, <p>Bomb Squad is neatly presented, if a little stuffily. It can’t really escape from being a collection of circuit boards with a countdown timer, but it’s all tidy and clear. The writing in those rather formal-looking pop-ups, however, is bright and cheerful, and most importantly, encouraging. And when it comes to games as educational tools, it entirely avoids the most dreadful pitfall of them all: wackiness. Phew.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/bom2.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are a couple of issues. I’ve encountered a bug where I couldn’t get the Level Select screen to do anything, which required a restart. And oh good lord, the music is <em>horrible</em>. The music played in the lift that descends to hell. Kill it, kill it with bombs and options screens. But beyond this, it’s a solid set up, functional rather than snazzy, but that’s appropriate to the task.</p>, <p>It also manages to achieve that bomb defusing essential – the moment of nervous uncertainty when you cut a wire, either leading to a sudden explosion, or the relief of simple nothingness.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/bom5.jpg"/></p>, <p>You may be thinking, “Hang on, weren’t Introversion working on a bomb game?” and you’re right. This time last year they revealed Wrong Wire alongside Scanner Sombre as a prototype, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/04/12/wrong-wire-preview/">I had a play of it at the time</a>. It was pretty good! But Bomb Squad Academy really doesn’t tread on its toes. Introversion’s game is a pure puzzler, and a lot more involved in terms of techniques. Although we’ve not heard a peep about it since. Meanwhile, Academy is entirely focused on tricking you into learning some basic electronics.</p>, <p>And that’s enough. I heartily encourage you to grab this if you’ve got a kid trying to learn it at school. Heck, if you’re a physics teacher you really should buy a bunch of copies, as this’ll be a surefire way to gain the attention of some of your students. Or if you just fancy reminding yourself about logic gates, pulse generators and capacitors, this is a neat little thing. I’d love to pretend I viewed it all as a smug expert pondering its usefulness for younger players, but that’s just flat-out not true – it taught me a whole bunch, as hard as I tried not to learn anything.

Smarter than half a dozen BioShocks despite looking a bit like it fell from a lost GameCube promotional disc, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/snake-pass/">Snake Pass</a> [<a href="http://www.snake-pass.com/">official site</a>] is an animal physics game without the slapstick comedy that often entails. (Tail, like a snake has). </p>, <p>I’m not sure if it’s best referred to as a platformer or a puzzle game. The main activity in Snake Pass is progressing from one platform to another, but where historically (hiss, like a snake) platformers involve high-speed bounding from place to place, this is about slow-speed slithering, climbing and clenching. You’re a snake, see. Snakes don’t jump, apart from in that bit in David Attenborough when one of them snatches a hummingbird out of the air or something.</p>, <p><span id="more-438603"></span></p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/16/apr/snakepass0.jpg"/></p>, <p>Snakes <em>crawl</em>. Snakes squeeze. Snakes wrap their long, legless bodies around things. So, what you need to learn here is how to be a snake. It’s an excellent (eggs, like I’m 90% sure snakes lay) concept and smartly delivered, despite the superficially kiddy skin (skin, like snakes shed). </p>, <p>Just to cover the appearance quickly before I slither (slither, like… no, I guess you got that one already) off to talk about how it works. It’s attractive and cheesy in equal measure. The Unreal engine gives the tropical theme park-esque environments a lovely lush sheen, while the few characters that there are are on the sub-Disney side of things. </p>, <p>Which I don’t begrudge (grudge, like snakes have against mongooses) at all, but simply feel that its hey kids! appearance is somewhat at odds with how bastard hard this thing can be. That said, I suspect the average 10 year old is infinitely better at games than I am. Anyway, I’d file Snake Pass’s aesthetic under ‘inoffensive’, and am simply satisfied that it doesn’t interfere with the smart, challenging physics-puzzling.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kW9uDgo7nlA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>Snake Pass is, like all platformers, all about movement. Movement here is very different from the norm, due to the lack of legs (legs, like snakes lack). Even simply moving forwards over even terrain is glacially slow – to pick up speed, you need to rhythmically turn left and right, creating the s-shaped crawl that snakes are known for (s-shaped crawls, like snakes are known for). Thing is, you won’t spend much time at all on even terrain, and more commonly have to apply that thinking to crawling along or, crucially, up poles and other constructions that invariably hang precariously over fatal drops. (Wilhelm screams, like snakes don’t actually do). </p>, <p>With judicious use of directional controls, the key trick is wrap yourself around something so you won’t simply fall off it, then inch along or up. There are moments when this becomes a natural, steady flow, the snake looping effortlessly around a series of poles as your hands dance gently across the controls, and others were progress is minute and stressful. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/sp2.jpg"/></p>, <p>As well as pure movement, also in the mix is a ‘grip’ button that locks part of the snake’s curled form in place, boa constrictor style, and one that calls a near-constant bird companion to lift your tail in the air in order to prevent its weight from dragging you down to Earth/into a bottomless chasm. Doing well at Snake Pass usually requires a sustained fluidity of control in addition to sussing out where you need to go and how not to fall off it – i.e. both dexterity and logical thinking.</p>, <p>If it sounds fiddly, it is. If it doesn’t sound fiddly, it is. But not bad fiddly. In some ways it puts me in mind of a more accessible take on GIRP and CLOP – consciously mapping controls against convention and instead with an interest in more accurately replicating reality. Smiley vegetarian snake and islands full of cheery mystical relics aside, that is. It’s one of those games where you can be deep into it and your mind switches into working on its wavelength – everything feels natural – but the next time you play, it feels like trying to ride a bike with your head. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/29snakepass.jpg"/></p>, <p>I dig both states, the former because I feel in the zone, the latter because seeming small achievements like getting to the top of this short tower or that plateau feel absolutely immense. It can hurtle into real difficulty though, like pulling levers in mid-air or timing a series of falls just so, and I’ll admit to moments of acute frustration. </p>, <p>I like Snake Pass best when it allows multiple, ad hoc-feeling solutions to the core challenge of how to get over there or on top of that, and a little less when there’s only one, precise way to do it and it takes me potentially dozens of attempts to do so. But it’s that sort of game – either you want that persistent challenge or you don’t.</p>, <p>Most of all, I marvel at how well it’s done snakes (snakes, like snakes). This could, as I say, have been all comic pratfalls and Goat Simulator destruction, but instead it’s an extremely careful study in how snakes navigate their bizarre bodies around, then transplanted into broadly well-done puzzle-places. I feel in awe of how well-realised this is, almost more than I actually enjoy it. I really do enjoy it though, so much so that I ended up picking it up for my Switch too (making it only the second game I own for Nintendo’s latest toy). Snake Pass gets an easy pass from me.\

In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/Thimbleweed-Park/">Thimbleweed Park</a> [<a href="https://thimbleweedpark.com/">official site</a>], few things are what they appear to be. The game, which reunites Ron Gilbert with his Maniac Mansion co-designer Gary Winnick, is a point and click comedy-mystery that looks like a relic from the past. Or, more accurately, like memories of the past; it has handsome lighting and a level of visual detail that actually fills in the blanks that memory often papers over.</p>, <p>Attractive as it is, should such pixels please your eye, it’s the quality of the story and the puzzles that really count. On one of those fronts, Thimbleweed eventually finds a way to go above and beyond anything I expected from it, but the combination of broad jokes and mystery-thriller sometimes creates confusion and frustration in both the narrative and the puzzling along the road.</p>, <p><span id="more-438049"></span></p>, <p>The first hour or two were equal parts a pleasant return to the comfort zone of point and click puzzling, and a sense that things were just a little <em>too</em> comfortable in Thimbleweed Park. The writing, in those early stages, has to do a lot of work, introducing lots of characters (five of them playable, eventually) and fleshing out the backstory of the town. The setting seemed muddled, with references to an all-powerful pillow factory magnate and ever-present vacuum tubes running everything from the crime-solving computers in the sheriff’s offices to the telephones and fire hydrants.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/thimbleweed1.jpg"/></p>, <p>A town with a pillow factory as its most magnificent achievement, inspiring awe in the residents, falls dangerously close to precisely the kind of zany humour that makes me cringe. A pillow factory, it seems, is funny because pillows are funny and not the sort of thing that impresses anyone in the real world. And two of the first characters you meet, the sheriff and coroner, share a similar sprite and the same voice actor using a different comedy speech pattern for each. It’s oh so wacky.</p>, <p>It’s easy to forget, as all of these daft characters and situations pile up, that Thimbleweed begins with a corpse. The sinister and mysterious aspects are quickly buried underneath a deluge of daft references and conversations that meander without doing very much to build the world, establish interesting characters or elaborate on the strong opening mystery. It seems to be a murder mystery in which nobody cares about the murder because they’re so intent on performing their comedy routines.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/thimbleweed2.jpg"/></p>, <p>And then there is an actual comedy routine, delivered in flashback by Ransome the Clown. I’ve written about Ransome before and I’m pleased to report that he continues to be a horrible delight right up until Thimbleweed’s final moments, but it’s his first appearance in that flashback that stabilised the game for me. Partly, it’s because Ransome is an easy character to understand – a jerk who gets his comeuppance – but it’s mostly because the flashback is a self-contained setting that allows the story to find its focus.</p>, <p>Because Thimbleweed quickly opens up, allowing any character to go to (almost) any location, the story isn’t told as efficiently as it could be were the structure more linear. To begin with you have just two characters to control, but they’re interchangeable, with one unifying motive and objective, and their own ulterior motives that remain hidden in the early stages. The three flashbacks, each of which introduces a new playable character, are useful anchors or punctuation, breaking the game into more manageable slices.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/thimbleweed3.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s odd to think of pacing as a problem in a point and click game, but more than anything else that’s what I struggled with in the opening hours. My interest was in solving a murder, but the game’s interest was in explaining exactly what Thimbleweed park is, from the pillow factory to the occult bookstore to the haunted hotel. It’s a complex place and not all of the individual parts and people gel together to give a sense of precisely why it is such a strange little ghost town.</p>, <p>That all settles down though and even if the bigger questions are left dangling until the final chapters, the town does start to cohere. It’s an odd place but its oddities – even the pillow factory and those vacuum tubes – are more than throwaway jokes or convenient and welcome puzzling short-hand (the tubes become a shortcut for many tasks that require a device to be repaired, so you don’t need to worry about carrying all manner of tools around).</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/thimbleweed4.jpg"/></p>, <p>There <em>are</em> throwaway jokes everywhere though and even the ones that got a laugh out of me sometimes felt like a distraction from the actual mystery portion of the game. Where the comedy and mystery elements are intertwined, they work fantastically well, and the humour doesn’t shy away from the story’s darker threads. Curses, death, loss, murder, families torn apart, anxiety, despair – individual lines and scenes are cheery and light-hearted, but the overall tone is rarely frivolous.</p>, <p>But Gilbert and his team have other plates to spin: Kickstarter rewards in the form of answering machine messages (and a stacked phonebook of names and numbers corresponding to them) and library books, and more in-jokes and callbacks than comfortably fit within the framework of the story. When you’re searching for a clue to advance the case, all of those names, numbers and allusions become an extra layer of noise to navigate. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/thimbleweed5.jpg"/></p>, <p>Is a number mentioned in a journal actually important or is it a pop culture reference? Is a witty line about the idiosyncracies of point and click adventures actually a hint about the conventions and how to break them, or simply…a witty line? It can be hard to cut through the sheer volume of asides and one-liners to find the clues that actually matter. To be clear, this isn’t a problem throughout the entire game, but one of the lead characters is an adventure game designer and an important location contains a Comic Con style ThimbleCon; that character and setting occasionally turn the volume up to eleven, though Delores (the game designer) swiftly became my favouite person in Thimbleweed. But, still, I never want to hear another line about the shame of working in the games industry. In my chosen, that’s unlikely. </p>, <p>Almost as soon as all of the characters were in play and the whole of Thimbleweed County was open for exploration, I settled into the game’s groove. Pacing was no longer a problem because I almost always had two or three major puzzles to chip away at, meaning I could turn away from one and to another if I got stuck. Eventually, of course, you hit bottlenecks, having solved all but one puzzle that will advance the story, but despite all of the distractions mentioned above, the world does have a strange but consistent logic. There wasn’t a single solution that felt unjustified and the couple of times I resorted to trial and error, the way forward I eventually stumbled across always made sense in retrospect.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/thimbleweed6.jpg"/></p>, <p>And when the characters are allowed to show their personalities and their past rather than acting as vessels for joke-delivery, they’re a fascinating bunch, with excellent voice acting. I particularly like Ray and Reyes, the agents. Ray rolls her eyes and treats Thimbleweed’s silliness with utter disdain – a much-needed voice of caustic reason – and Reyes is nervous and naive in a way that immediately made me suspicious. Everyone in Thimbleweed is an unreliable narrator and even though you’re controlling these people, you aren’t actually <em>being</em> them; their secrets remain their own, until they choose to reveal them.</p>, <p>I could quibble (am am going to, clearly) about how the player characters don’t actually speak to one another, except on are scripted occasions, and can’t share information effectively. How Delores can give Reyes an item that helps to resolve his entire storyline but that he is oblivious to it. How I never want to ride an elevator again because the wait between floors feels eternal when you’re struggling to figure out a puzzle. How some of the actual rules of being a ghost don’t seem entirely consistent. I’ve made notes about so many things that made me frown, but they don’t add up to more than one big frown, and it’s countered by the much bigger grin I had for the back half of the game (it took me sixteen hours to finish and I only got properly stuck a couple of times).</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/thimbleweed7.jpg"/></p>, <p>This has been a tricky review to write because some of the things that I love about Thimbleweed will almost certainly be off-putting to other people, and some parts that fell flat might well be your favourite moments. It’s a dense game, which means that if one joke fails to land, there’s almost certainly a follow-up that just might, hot on its heels. The bigger picture – which I’m unwilling to reveal because this begins as a whodunnit but eventually becomes a whatisit – ties everything together, making a tidy package of all the loose threads and awkward gags. </p>, <p>I thoroughly enjoyed most of the journey, despite a few unhappy detours, but the ending brought everything together in a way that didn’t just resolve the characters’ individual stories in a satisfying way, but found the emotional beat at the heart of their investigations. Not in every case, but certainly with three of the five. Though it rushes to its conclusion once the cat is out of the bag and I was a little let-down by the way smaller mysteries are absorbed into the Big Question raised in the final act (though hinted at previously), Thimbleweed’s final moments made me sad to say goodbye. Properly sad, with the suggestion of a little sniffle and everything. I suspect that ending will be divisive. Some people will make like Ray and roll their eyes.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/thimbleweed8.jpg"/></p>, <p>By the end, all of my earlier frustrations didn’t seem to matter, though it’s important to remember that they absolutely did at times during the hours I was playing, and if I was disappointed at all it was because Thimbleweed Park doesn’t pack more emotional punches into its running time. As the individual stories play out, Ransome and Delores in particular show that Gilbert and his team care for their characters and their disappointments. This is more recognisably the work of writers who showed empathy for Guybrush and Elaine and their dreams than the people who brought us insult swordfighting. </p>, <p>At the beginning of the game, I’d hoped to solve a mystery and have a few laughs, but now I miss the company of this little crew. It’s a smart game though and a thoughtful one, even if it sometimes hides those qualities behind its clown makeup and a beaglepuss. The final puzzle sequence in particular shows just how long a game Terrible Toybox have been playing with the design. It’s a callback that works as more than a joke. At their worst, the many adventure game references feel almost apologetic, as if the game isn’t entirely confident in its own skin, but as it moves toward an ending, it embraces its own oddities and past in a way that left me entirely satisfied.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/thimbleweed9.jpg"/></p>, <p>And for all of that that, I can forgive a few too-vague clues and the jokes that fell flat. It’s a beautiful game as well, the non-interactive foregrounds adding as much life to the world as the backgrounds. Even the old-school verb system, which I was wary of, doesn’t get in the way, with a right click always picking the most sensible options, and others existing for laughs or mild experimentation. Oh, and before I leave you, one piece of advice that might save you some time: as soon as one character has a map, the rest can collect one from an obvious place. Don’t do what I did and spend precious time sprint-clicking around the world.

Le Réprobateur</a> is an extremely unusual piece of French multimedia IF. It is a personal favorite of mine — so odd, so unlike anything else out there — but for the past few years it has been difficult to recommend to people, because it was not only commercial, but also unreliable about installation. (At least, so reported the friends who tried to play it.) But <em>Le Réprobateur</em>‘s author François Coulon has just re-released it, for free, in a browser-accessible format, and now anyone can get at it. The browser version is a tiny bit less elegant here and there than the original presentation, but what you get in exchange is something that actually functions on a modern computer.<span id="more-438005"></span></p>, <p>The premise is — well, let me give you Coulon’s own blurb:</p>, <p>Paris, 1984. Gildas is a reprover, a professional hired by his patients to follow them wherever they go and silently condemn their behavior. Called for help by Magali, unable to resist compulsive shopping and French pastries on her own, he starts to fall in love with the young woman, breaking every rule….</p>, <p>The story imagines a role somewhere between priest and personal trainer, and asks how this person might intercept some particular characters, in an alternate 1980s France. What happens when a professional sports team hires a Reprover to keep its athletes in training? When a writer needs reproof to get past writer’s block? To glare at misbehaving lions in the circus?</p>, <p>Meanwhile, there is also a profession of Approvers, whose job is to run around and cheerlead anything you do: a cure for imposter syndrome, anxiety, and generalized forms of cowardice, but not, of course, without its ethical dangers. </p>, <p> </p>, <p>I said this was multimedia IF. Each page has several short prose passages, just a sentence or two long, describing some anecdotes from the career of Gildas or one of the other characters he meets along the way. These sentences morph when you click on them, expanding to show additional nuances or takes on what is going on. The effect is reminiscent of Twine’s text rotation functions, except that <em>Le Réprobateur</em> came out in 2008, before Twine had taken off, and before the creation of most of the macros that provide that functionality. </p>, <p>Even aside from the mechanical effect of having new phrases and adjectives pop in and out of view, the text does not read entirely naturalistically. It is translated from French, and while I am guessing that the original text adopted a humorously formal tone, the results in English are downright alien — though often still funny.</p>, <p>In addition to the prose, each page offers three illustrations and one video snippet. The illustrations are in a cartoonish or graphic novel style, but despite their size, are crowded with supporting detail, often further explaining what is happening in the text.</p>, <p>Then, each video snippet shows Gildas the reprover speaking to camera in French, occupying a role between narrator and character. He speaks slowly and clearly, so that those of us with somewhat less-than-fluent French have plenty of time to match his utterances with the subtitles. He belongs to the school of acting that emotes with its eyebrows. (In this school he is a fellow student of Emma Watson. You can ruin all the Harry Potter movies just by watching for Hermione’s eyebrow acrobatics. You’re welcome.) In these videos, he is quite likely to be doing his calisthenics or sipping a green cocktail in the bath, as if you were receiving his candid input in the moment that he had these particular thoughts.</p>, <p>And on top of all of these, there is a four-part soundtrack, which you can activate partly or fully, so that you’re hearing just a basic track or additional elements on top. Or silence. Whichever you choose.</p>, <p>There are twenty pages in total, and you can navigate between them either by clicking on one of the page’s three illustrations, or by zooming out to a 3D view, which maps the entire story onto the surface of a D20. You can then rotate the D20 and decide which face to look at next. </p>, <p><img alt="screenshot from Le Reprobateur" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/LeReprobateurD20.png"/></p>, <p>Either way, the structure encourages you to think about the thematic links between the story on one page and the story on the next. </p>, <p>This may all sound both stilted and needlessly complex. In practice, it’s pretty easy to get the hang of after a few pages. As for the style, that never becomes less strange, but it does grow on you: or at least, it grew on me, as an expression of a subversive humor that never takes itself seriously, always attentive to the foibles of the main characters. It is also, at least from the perspective of other IF, almost entirely <em>sui generis</em>: part social satire, part literary short story, beholden to none of the usual IF or hypertext tropes and conceits, and not even apparently aware of their existence. This made it refreshing in 2008, and it still feels so now.</p>, <p>What emerges from both the story and the mechanic is an idea of nearly infinite layering and differences of perspective. <em>Le Réprobateur</em> is constantly showing you its characters’ different views on what is going on. You, the reader, are constantly revisiting and morphing the prose and the music, or choosing to juxtapose this pair of pages. </p>, <p>Within the fiction, the existence of Approvers and Reprovers suggests that absolutely any act could, with the right framing and in the hands of the proper professional, be considered laudable or the reverse. Moreover (the story suggests), our ability to show discipline or self-restraint is very socially dependent, conditioned on the feedback that we’re receiving at the time.</p>, <p><img alt="screenshot from Le Reprobateur" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/LeReprobateurTears.png"/></p>, <p>Considering all this, it’s probably appropriate that the player has no diegetic agency at all. You can’t change the story. All the texts, images, and videos are written in advance and may be experienced in any order. But your personal exploration of the space is a unique journey. The story begins on a different page whenever you restart it, as though rolling the giant D20 on which the pages are inscribed.</p>, <p>If you do like this piece, Coulon has also created a series called <a href="https://prisemultiple.fr/">Prise Multiple</a>, a set of video compositions offering multiple views on the same scenarios.</p>, <p>I should add a word of warning: there are characters in the story, if not the author himself, who express some racist perspectives. I had forgotten that fact until replaying; it was an unpleasant jolt to the system, even when couched in the perspective of a man otherwise represented as rather hidebound in several respects.

Every week we dump Brendan out the back of a plane and into the hotbed of gunfire that veterans know only as ‘early access’. This week, the competitive murderfields of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/">PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</a> [<a href="http://www.playbattlegrounds.com/main.pu">official site</a>].</i></p>, <p>I’m halfway across the river when the net starts closing in. A huge electric field looms up behind me, sparkling and fizzing and nipping at my heels as I swim for my life. Having just dodged a player driving by in his jeep, I was now going to die of wounds slowly inflicted over time by the game itself, simply for not being in the right place. I kicked and swam, even as the electric field overtook me and my screen started to slowly bleed. If I didn’t reach the safe zone soon – marked by a white circle on the mini-map, I’d be dead. Oh well, I figured, there are less interesting ways to go.<br/>
<span id="more-437961"></span></p>, <p>This is PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, the new ‘Battle Royale’ game from Bluehole and Brendan Greene, the developer behind Arma’s battle royale and H1Z1’s King of the Hill. But if you’re hoping for something a little fresh from one of the format’s experienced progenitors, turn now and walk sadly away. There’s absolutely nothing here of novelty. It’s just another shooter on a big map.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/PE_battlegrounds5.jpg"/></p>, <p>As such, there isn’t much to explain. After a gathering screen, you are thrust onto a plane with 99 other players, where you’ll skydive out onto the 8km x 8km island below. Depending on what you’ve picked on the menu screen, you’re all either fighting solo or murdering it out in groups of two or four. Seeing where people drop and picking your own safe and uncrowded landing spot is the first major challenge. Actually, strike that. The first major challenge is making it through the airplane ride.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/PE_battlegrounds1.jpg"/></p>, <p>The trademark title of the game puts everything in capitals – PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS – as if the game itself is shouting at you, a fitting moniker for a game in which all players spend the first 30-60 seconds in the plane screaming at each other like a bus full of children on their way to a borstal. There’s bad singing, racial slurs, meaningless squealing. It is like some chemistry genius filtered and distilled all the toxicity from online gaming into a single aluminium cylinder. You can mute the whole place as soon as you appear, and I suggest that you do.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/PE_battlegrounds8.jpg"/></p>, <p>Once you’re out and soaring through the air, the desire is to find a place with equipment and supplies. Guns, in other words. There are first aid kits and grenades of differing types, as well as clothes and the obligatory motorcycle helmets, but what you really want is a good old-fashioned AK, or an M16. The rush for these weapons isn’t as frantic as in H1Z1, I found. If you drop into a peaceful area with no other ‘contestants’ you’ll easily survive long enough to find a good firearm, and possibly even a scope, special magazine, or some other kind of attachment. Backpacks and helmets have different levels, clearly stated when you stand by them, allowing you to hold more or withstand more damage if you get shot in the bonce, something that’d otherwise straight-up kill you.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/PE_battlegrounds7.jpg"/></p>, <p>Within minutes, the game starts warning you to move. A circle on your map denotes the next safe zone (and a red area denotes a place about to be bombed by planes). In this case, “safe zone” means somewhere you can exist where the game won’t zap you for standing around, as opposed to an actual place of safety. Like its older brothers, Battlegrounds wastes no energy or thought by leaving it up to you whether to team up or kill people you meet. The aim is always to kill. This isn’t DayZ or the Division’s dark zone, where there are advantages and disadvantages to attacking another player. This is vanilla, kill-em-all elimination. This has always been a sad thing for the genre, I’ve found, since it makes no new demands of the players and introduces nothing to the “game” of survival that we have not seen before. Battle royales done in this way will always tend towards, or simply be, a deathmatch without the benefit of concise level design.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/PE_battlegrounds3.jpg"/></p>, <p>But there’s plenty of people who are up for that, clearly. The loud swarms of players in Battlegrounds must be at least partly composed of those fed up with H1Z1. But what they expect to find here of note, I’m not sure. Maybe the appeal is that this is more or less the same thing, but with a new map? Maybe everyone just thinks that this time – <em>this time</em> – the game will actually be finished. I don’t know. I joined up expecting something a little fresher or different. I should have expected the game’s narrow-mindedness the moment it wouldn’t accept my nickname.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/PE_battlegrounds4.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are times of tension and excitement, like in any hunger game. The reason I was swimming for my life, for example, was because a flashed warning informed me that in 30 seconds the noose would tighten. But there was a bay to cross. The only way over was a steel bridge some 500 meters or so away, and just reaching that bridge would actually take me back towards the edge of the now-closing circle of death. I had to make a choice – run for the bridge and pray, or jump in the water and swim.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/PE_battlegrounds2.jpg"/></p>, <p>As it turned out, you swim <em>verrrryy sloooowllyyyy</em>. But it was still enough of a head start. I made it to the next safe zone, hurt but alive, and just in time to see the next warning flash up and start running for my life all over again. There were 18 people left alive at this point, and I hadn’t even been in a shootout with anyone yet.</p>, <p>That would change within a few minutes, as the sound of an unseen car came from a nearby compound. The engine stopped and I saw the vehicle (empty, quiet) before I saw the driver (crouching, shooting). I was peppered with bullets and became the 13<sup>th</sup>-last person to die.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/PE_battlegrounds10.jpg"/></p>, <p>In squads I died much more quickly, a result of the over-confidence of groups and speed at which a gang of four can hoover up all the goodies in a house and move onto the next. There’s tension there too; you might be gathering up some new boots, just for kicks, when suddenly a shot rings out. This is something the game does well – the sound of distant gunfire. But how distant? A second flurry of shots ring out, this time closer. Everyone gets ready, looking at the horizon to the south. But then, out of the west, a jeeps zooms in and empties four angry men behind the cover of an old warehouse. Whoever it was that was shooting to the south will now hear, in the distance, the shots that spell your own death.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/PE_battlegrounds11.jpg"/></p>, <p>But even these life-by-life climaxes can’t really change what this is: another battle royale game with nothing original to say. Given the chance to inject some life into a genre that is fast losing all its novelty, Bluehole and PlayerUnknown have seemingly decided to shrug and just do “more of the same”. For many, that’s enough. But I’m looking for a more interesting way to die.

It’s time to walk the streets (well, street) of mid-80s New York as a down-on-his-luck patrol officer, handing out parking tickets, and er, handing out some more parking tickets. But! But handing out parking tickets while people all around you shout racist and sexist stuff, because it’s set in the ’80s! It’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/Beat-Cop/">Beat Cop</a> [<a href="http://beatcopgame.com/">official site</a>]. Something something Senator, something something diamonds, something something parking tickets. Here’s wot I think.<span id="more-437725"></span></p>, <p>At first glance Beat Cop looks like something akin to the Sierra Police Quest games of the late 80s/early 90s, a combination of point-and-click adventure and fiddly paperwork procedural. Ooh, intriguing. But just a few minutes in it becomes apparent this is far closer to a Diner Dash-like frantic management games, with swearing. Just, not a particular good version of the format.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/beat2.jpg"/></p>, <p>Right, so, a premise. You play Officer Jack Kelly, a former detective who’s been bumped down to a beat cop after some vaguely explained incident with a Senator, a murder, and some stolen diamonds. Your bosses know you’re being framed for the death, but everyone seems to think you stole the jewels. You’re back on the bottom rung, in a squad with four other dodgy police officers, and have to patrol a single pixelated street every day until you can prove your innocence. Each morning your squad’s grumpy boss comments on how you did the day before, and gives you a list of tasks to complete. It might be making sure you meet a quota of ten parking tickets, while visiting a particular store to speak to the owner, and making sure you’re at a certain locations at certain times to make arrests, perform searches, that sort of lark.</p>, <p>But time goes awfully quickly in Beat Cop. About five minutes every couple of seconds. The idea being that you have to economise your choices and actions in any single day, choose which tasks to complete, which to let fall aside. It emphasises this to you again and again in the early sections, your fellow officers repeatedly telling you that completing all tasks just can’t be done. Except there’s a rather big flaw here: it’s generally perfectly possible to easily get everything done, and sometimes more besides. The game throws distractions at you, pitching you between the two rival gangs, the Italian Mafia, and the black street gangs known as The Crew. Each will ask you to help them out, or cause problems for the other, and you can choose whether to do so, your reputation with either affected by your decisions. And there’s time for this too. There are also random thefts, minor incidents with shopkeepers, and scripted events in various apartments. Yup, them too. The game gives you a bonus if you’re able to double your ticket quota, but as I discovered thanks to just how poorly the whole time management has been, well, managed, doesn’t give you anything extra for <em>quadrupling</em> it.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/beat3.jpg"/></p>, <p>Generally, I’ve only failed at tasks not because there isn’t time in the day, but because your character’s movement is so idiotically slow and time is so weirdly handled that it’s simply not possible to walk the hundred or so metres you need to cross in less than the time given by a pop-up alert. Other times it’s because the game is simply wrong – you’re repeatedly told to catch the guy in the green jumper, when the perp is in fact wearing a white vest. So later when I was told to arrest a guy in a purple dressing gown, and picked up a guy in a pink dressing gown in the right place at the right time, I assumed it was another flaw. Not that time, so that was a task failed.</p>, <p>There’s also a very idiosyncratic understanding of choice. Minor decisions are yours to make, whether to take a bribe, buy drugs from a dealer, or accept the advances of a prostitute, but when it comes to – say – how to respond to an abusive uncle mistreating his niece, there’s no dialogue option to arrest him or otherwise. Instead Kelly just kicks the shit out of him and reports to dispatch that he fell down the stairs. Kelly’s scripted response to most crime is excessive force and illegal cover-ups, making a real farce of what it is <em>you</em> actually get to do with most of your time playing the game: checking car tyres for low tread, or issuing tickets for expired meters.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/beat4.jpg"/></p>, <p>Oh, and it’s revolting. It’s worth noting that the game’s fundamental design flaws ensure it’s not particularly enjoyable to play, before any content issues come up. But they come up, all the time.</p>, <p>Beat Cop is a game that very much wants to have its cake and eat it. Set in 1986, it steeps itself in the very worst imaginings of police corruption amidst rampant prejudice, but in a way that after a little while starts to feel a lot less like referencing, and a lot more like revelling. It indulges itself in swathes of ugly racism, sexism and corruption, but without seeming to understand the reality of the mid-80s era, nor having the guts to embrace it fully. For instance, black people are incessantly referred to by the game as “darkies”, so much that it feels really… peculiar, but it then appears too cowardly to ever have anyone derogatorily use the word “nigger”. (One black character does say “nigga” at one point.)</p>, <p>Chinese are “slanty” and “yellow”, gay people are “faggy”. What a treat. Italians are similarly slighted, but again it chickens out before it gets to the slurs that would actually have been said. We get all manner of lazy pasta-based references, plus a bit of “greaseball”, but never “wop”. The writing indulges in gleeful abuse, but it’s too scared to go to some places.</p>, <p>Not so scared when it comes to talking about women, though! The morning meetings with your squad are a gala of sexually abusive language aimed at the one female officer. Lovely descriptions of a colleague’s “sensitive dick”, who they’ve fucked, and offers to have sex with her. And gosh, you don’t see the word “cunt” in games very often, but you’ll see it very often in this game.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/beat6.jpg"/></p>, <p>Now, all of that is fine! If you’re depicting racism and sexism, you can’t do it without using racist and sexist terms. But the question here becomes: why? Why is it being depicted? So far as I’ve been able to discern, the most realistic reason <em>here</em> is because it was thought fun to do so.</p>, <p>There’s this curious belief that if one sets one’s game in a particular era, there’s carte blanche to portray the negative stereotypes of the time, but never the negative <em>effects</em> of them. So the thinking starts, “People could get away with offering to fuck their female colleagues in the 80s, and they didn’t get in trouble at work!” but never manages to reach, “and that was really, really shit for women.”</p>, <p>That certain voices were silenced at that time isn’t a very good reason to gleefully silence them when portraying it now. It’s as if some people believe that the <em>consequences</em> of abusive language were only introduced at the time when it became socially unacceptable to voice it. So when you depict the past, hey, people didn’t mind! Women and people of colour knew their place back then, before they were promoted to their new place these days, right?</p>, <p>(Let’s be clear: I’m not attributing these thoughts to the developers. Just commenting on how such a portrayal comes across to me as I play.)</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/beat7.jpg"/></p>, <p>Some will take issue that I’ve given as much space to that topic as to the game’s design flaws, but it’s instructive to how such content dominates the game. That sums up Beat Cop, really: a game in which what you actually do is tediously trudge back and forth across the same street over and over and over, primarily handing out parking tickets, but set in a pigsty of corruption and prejudice. Good grief, the game would be FAR better if you were actually taking part in the latter! At least it wouldn’t be Diner Dash meets Meter Maid Simulator! </p>, <p>It drags on for such a long time, repetitive day after day, some made slightly different by having a twist – you have to look after a Russian cop (who accidentally kills a man by wanking him too hard), you have to keep the street clear of all parked cars that day, you have to check for busted car lights. The stuff about the Senator, the framing, the missing diamonds – that all happens to you in conversations in which you play no part, agonisingly infrequently throughout.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/beat9.jpg"/></p>, <p>The farther you get in, the more it starts to crumble. Tasks are given to you after their deadline time has already passed. You’re penalised half your pay cheque for tasks given when the day is almost over, like not catching a tagger who isn’t where the radio report says he is, and then can’t be caught up with before that day’s time elapses. In fact, coincidentally being at the location of an event as you’re radioed about it seems to break everything, at one point causing me to have a game over because I couldn’t stop a man from setting himself on fire, because the game didn’t trigger the scripts. (Yay, I got to dish out fifteen sodding parking tickets all over again for that day!)</p>, <p>I’ve played it for so damned long, and have just run out of patience with it, and absolutely do not care any more about the arc story. It’s taken so long to go anywhere, crawling along every few days of play, and just isn’t compelling at all. When the reality of playing is failing yet another challenge because the game’s car searching mini-game is broken from start to finish, rather than getting involved in the intrigue of its police corruption tale, there’s no motivation to stick around. I got shot at, entirely randomly, while looking at my screen-covering notepad, and honestly I’m happy that I died. That’s a good enough ending for me.

A trickle of wholesome GIFs has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/01/16/rain-worlds-slippery-slugcat-is-coming-to-pc-this-year/">tantalising us</a> with post-apocalyptic platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/rain-world/">Rain World</a> [<a href="http://www.adultswim.com/games/pc-console/rain-world/">official site</a>] and its adorable protagonist the slugcat for some time now. It’s out tomorrow and I have been hopping and swimming and munching my way through its dripping, humid world of predator and prey over the past week to tell you wot I think. First: I am certain it’s going to become a cult hit with a crowd of hardcore, mystery-loving obsessives behind it. But secondly, it has also left me with the impression of a badly missed opportunity. Equal parts astounding and hands-tearing-out-your-hair frustrating, this adventure, like the slugcat itself, is a bit of a mix.<span id="more-437667"></span></p>, <p>The story is all it needs to be – you are a slugcat who has been separated from your family. Off you go into this unsettling world of narrow drain pipes and soggy piles of garbage to find them. You need to eat to survive and avoid being eaten by the various hissing lizards and fearsome critters that prowl from screen to screen looking to fill their own stomachs.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_15.jpg"/></p>, <p>The blue fruits hanging from vines and bats that flutter about are your first introduction to the dining rituals of the slugcat, but there are many more types of food. There’s no constantly-depleting survivalist meter as such, just a line of seven pips that fill with each morsel (the pips aren’t “health” or “stamina” but they do empty in another way, which I’ll talk about later). Like much of the game, I’d rather avoid talking too much about those later foodstuffs, because discovering exactly what they are and how to eat them is part of the game’s sense of animalistic curiousity, one of its greatest strengths. And you <i>will</i> have to discover most of these for yourself, because this is a game that, notwithstanding the first few screens, absolutely loathes explaining itself.</p>, <p>That makes talking about its virtues much harder for me. I’m avoiding screenshots of many animals because it’s best in its surprising moments. When you suddenly spot a new type of beast appearing out of a hole in the ground and run to the other side of the screen in a panic. Or when you finally understand what those little blue seedlings are for. Or when a creature you thought was dangerous, actually turns out to be more or less harmless so long as you leave it alone. If there’s a puzzle element to the game (and it’d be a stretch to say that there is) it’s in figuring out how the whole food chain fits together and what your place is in it. Who eats who? What are these fruits good for? What do I do with this pearl?</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_2.jpg"/></p>, <p>In its revelatory moments, or in moments of sheer drama (avoiding camouflaged beasts in a tunnel system, catching a glimpse of a black tail in a tank of deep water) Rain World really does shine. The world is a <i>huuuuuuge</i> collection of screens and environments, each with particular threats and obstacles. Each area is woven together by bolt holes, and you can see a multi-layered map of everything you’ve uncovered by holding down a shoulder button.</p>, <p>There’s some direction in the form of small eye-creatures that appear like weeds out of crevices in the rock or rusted metal. They will point you towards bats or fruits, and sometimes flash an image of a slugcat by a bolt hole (suggesting that they might know which way your family has gone) or some other mysterious image. However, their directions become less and less frequent as you go on, I found. Regardless of their directions, the desire to explore every region as fully as possible will infect you. Overcoming pitfalls and puzzling at dead ends is all part of being a lost animal in this weird place. But obviously, there is a bigger threat than lizards and unknown beasts: the rain.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_4.jpg"/></p>, <p>This comes periodically. I never timed it, but it felt like maybe every fifteen minutes or so. After a while, you get a sense for when rainfall is near. A little meter in the bottom left is telling you this, a cricle of dots ticking down to zero (not that the game offers you this information). But you also know when rain is about to fall because the sky starts to darken and the land shakes, slowly at first, then faster. It rains in a brief shower, nothing you can’t handle. But then this stops and everything goes still. Then: “tink!” A single sharp drop of what I can only describe as “super rain”. Tink tink! Two drops. TINK TINK TINK TINK TINK. Suddenly, the screen is lost in sledgehammer water. If you’re caught in the rain, you are dead.</p>, <p>To survive each shower, you need to find special hibernation chambers, marked with a boxy symbol. To hibernate, you need to have eaten enough food – at least four pips worth. The hibernation process will always use up four pips of food, which means each new “morning” you are hungry again. Critically, these chambers are also your save points. And this is where it all starts to unravel for me. Because Rain World is cursed with some of the most teeth-grindingly bad checkpointing in any modern-day platformer.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_3.jpg"/></p>, <p>The hibernation chambers are often very far apart. In theory this fits with the survivalist theme. Living “winter” to “winter” while hiding and running from vicious predators of the natural world isn’t easy. Just ask any rabbit. But in reality this means you will often be repeating the same bunch of screens numerous times only to die from a frightening creature that ambushes you out of nowhere. That’s because the other creatures are spread out at the AI’s will. Sometimes, there are none to be seen. Sometimes three predators will appear at once, blocking your way to the next area or surrounding you from multiple avenues. Sometimes you take a bolt hole into the next screen and straight into the jaws of a waiting lizard.</p>, <p>Other times you get caught in a game of Darwinian Pacman, trapped in narrow passages between two types of beast, both vying for your blood, with no way past either of them. It is all completely random and unavoidable. The best solution to getting past predators is often to accept death and try again – because next time they might not be in the same place. While all this replicates the brutish, nasty and short nature of the wilder-apocalypse, it makes for a frustrating platformer. Early on, the repetition of screens and areas is more forgiveable. But later you will navigate twenty or so screens only to die from some accident of fate. When you respawn, none of the map you have uncovered has been saved. This might have been Rain World’s most serious crime, if you didn’t count the controls.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_5.jpg"/></p>, <p>These are a baffling frustration. Sometimes you’ll land from a height and roll without meaning to, sometimes you’ll press down to duck into a hole and end up rolling around on the ground like a vulnerable white meatball. Very often, you will enter tunnels backwards, travelling much slower than normal (there’s a way to turn around, but it too is slow). Sometimes you’ll wiggle left or right while on a pole, trying to prepare for a jump and the game will think you want to “unhook” from the pole, resulting in a lethal fall. Sometimes you’ll be legging it from a deadly creature and suddenly stick to a pole because of the way your thumbstick is angled. I can’t count the deaths I have suffered because of an annoying control issue, whether it was rolling off a tower or ducking into the wrong crevice and missing my chance to escape into a proper bolt hole.</p>, <p>These crevices are particularly frustrating. They are everywhere, carved into walls and the ground. Other creatures can appear from them, which is fine, because this makes it feel like your predators have their own separate system of bolt holes. But to you, they are totally useless, and worse, they get in the way. They are stubby dead ends not deep enough to hide in, yet the slugcat will start to clamber in if you are pushing the stick vaguely towards one. This would not be such a big problem, except that real bolt holes are almost always surrounded by these false nooks. Put this together with awkward, sticky controls and you will often be putting your cat’s head down the wrong hole. In split-second pursuits, this means the difference between life and death. Back to the last hibernation pod for you, kitten.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_6.jpg"/></p>, <p>That’s just one example of the way the tar-like controls taint the sense of adventure. The process of holding and throwing objects is also weirdly inconsistent. I just wrote and subsequently deleted an entire paragraph in which I tried to explain the system of picking things up, swallowing them, regurgitating, putting them down, throwing, and swapping items between paws. I deleted it because the description was so riddled with minor details and exceptions that the paragraph read like a bizarre legal document.</p>, <p>“The left paw will be the thrower, insofar as there is no spear in the right paw, until such time that there is another more lethal object in the counterpaw, in which instance the thrown object will defer to the judgement of the game’s instructions, or to the nature of the object in the right paw.”</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_7.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s a mess. Carrying a useful object ten screens to use it in a particular place, and then accidentally throwing it away just as you approach your goal, is a regular occurrence. All these problems are especially surprising because the game markets itself as having a hero with “nimble movements” and “natural fluidity”. But I cannot think of a less befitting description for this troublesome animal. It’s a shame. For a platformer bad controls can be fatal. I don’t think they outright kill Rain World’s charisma and charm, but they’ve definitely maimed it.</p>, <p>In many ways, Rain World isn’t trying to be a platformer – it is more in love with mystery and discovery and it pays equal homage to the Metroidvanias of the world. But in all the important mechanical ways, it remains tied to that ancestral genre of leaping from ledge to ledge. You need to run and jump and climb and swim and throw things, often at speed in order to escape some otherworldly nasty running behind you with its toothy maw ajar.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_8.jpg"/></p>, <p>Yet the controls feel stubbornly designed. Sticky, surly, often uncooperative. There are so many things that would make them feel better (a higher jump, less “weight”, a more sensible way to throw, drop and swap items) and yet those considerations seemed to have been ignored in favour of a method of movement that, yes, <i>looks</i> sublime yet often handles horribly.</p>, <p>People will look at the toughness and the deaths and cite Limbo as a comparison. But for me, it is much more reminiscent of Abe’s various Oddysees and Exodduses (Exoddi?) The world is gorgeous, the characters are likeable, and the enemies especially are scary and fascinating in equal measure, and are often pitted against one another in clever ways that make the landscape feel bustling with life.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_9.jpg"/></p>, <p>But Abe too had an aggravating control scheme (although his required pinpoint precision and meticulous timing, whereas the slugcat just feels sticky). Abe too forced you to run onto new screens in a panic without knowing that there would be a pitfall or a trap waiting for you. Abe too sought pleasure in being masochistic. A carnivourous plant disguised as a pole is simply Rain World’s version of an unlabelled lever that, when pulled, crushes you beneath a giant rack of ribs. In so many ways it echoes the strengths of that lovable green farter but it also retains all the flaws, and in fact introduces whole new ones – at least Abe gave you a quicksave.</p>, <p>Modern platformers that want to be difficult have learned the value of a quick and nearby spawn. Fell into some spikes? Never mind, says the game, and one second later you are at the last brick wall you leapt from. The slugcat doesn’t get this treatment, instead it is transported back to the nearest save point, the last hibernation chamber. The things you have done to the environment have been undone, the parts of the map you revealed have been recovered in shroud. You are ten screens back from where you were, only now the predators and prey will be in different places.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_10.jpg"/></p>, <p>It can get hugely frustrating, especially in those parts of the world where you have to navigate bothersome pools of leeches, or wall-jump up long shafts, or seek out a certain object before facing an otherwise impossible obstacle. Having to repeat these areas doesn’t feel like an exercise in hardcore gaming, it just feels like a chore. Some of the areas feel like you’d need the developer’s debug tools just to get through. It’s demoralising. You want to explore the next area, encounter the next weird tentacled species. But the game does everything it can to stop you from doing this. It is astounding that, after navigating twenty or thirty screens, you will die because a random enemy has spawned off the edge of the screen, impossible to see, and snapped you up with its tongue.</p>, <p>The oddest thing about it is that, like the controls, this difficulty feels entirely deliberate. It is like Rain World wants to have the strength of difficulty we find in Dark Souls. But that classic of dying and re-dying had the impetus of soul currency, a sense of gambling, a sense of pace, and the relief of clever shortcuts with near-perfect geography. Not to mention the HUGELY SIGNIFICANT gesture of always putting the enemies reliably in the same place, like a solid, immovable set of spiky hurdles. You always had the means to overcome and defeat them. You just needed to learn.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_11.jpg"/></p>, <p>Here there is only the obstacle of repeating the same awkward platforming sections over and over again, sometimes being put out of your misery by a creature that gobbles you up out of the blue or makes your intended route suddenly impassable. It takes everything platformers have learned not to do over the last 10 years and throws each lesson over its shoulder into the waste basket. It definitely gains some originality thanks to this exercise, but it is often at the expense of basic playability.</p>, <p>I’m wailing on it quite a lot here, which may seem unfair. But it’s only because so much potential has been lost. There’s a ton of things to fall in love with. The world is vast and wonderfully drawn. The process of discovery is wonderful, and it puts an encouraging amount of trust in the player to figure things out by themselves. As for the natural world it conveys, it can feel like living through a surreal season of BBC’s Planet Earth, set thousands of years after mankind’s demise. I have had run-ins with animals that have made me shiver, squeal or grin from ear to ear. A particular creature was so instinctively frightening that I had to take a short break to regain my courage before taking the slugcat on a long swim across some open water. He did not survive.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_12.jpg"/></p>, <p>And there’s depth here too. Creatures and mysterious personas are hidden at the extremities of the map, offering some small aid or boost, although you might not know how or why they do so until much later. There’s a method of travelling vast distances and it takes some experimentation to figure this system out. You might put something in your gullet and forget all about it, only for it to become suddenly very helpful two regions later, where you can vomit it up and put it to use. And these are just the details I figured out. There’s much more that I’d love to discuss with another player – what do those little [REDACTED] do? Did you visit the [REDACTED] with all those terrifying [REDACTED]? And – oh my god – what exactly are the consequences of eating the [REDACTED] by that [REDACTED]?</p>, <p>I’m at a disadvantage with the review copy, see, since I don’t have the sanctuary of discussion threads or friends who’ve already clocked it to relieve my most pressing confusions, unlike y’all. It’s a game that I think will benefit from that out-sourcing of help, the many hands and many eyes of the internet making up for the lack of in-game teachings (although, being honest, it feels like it could have benefited from more voices in the testing phase too – maybe one of them would have said: “Uh, don’t you think the controls are a bit wonky?” or “Maybe we should, like, lay off”).</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_13.jpg"/></p>, <p>So I don’t want to rubbish the experience too much. Apart from the mysteries and secrets, there is a cracking array of vicious wildlife on show here, and their accompanying methods of predation can be as impressive as they are unsettling. It often feels like a real, brutish ecosystem. Even if the AI sometimes acts weirdly, spasming in a corner, or twirling around in endless circles, it still seems earthly, red in tooth and claw, but also alien and unknown. Finding out exactly how that aquatic animal feeds or which sub-species of lizard acts in which manner is a joy. I just wish I could do that without having to repeat the same swim through cramped and flooded tunnels for the fifth time. Or the same protracted run across the ultra-dark [REDACTED], with, yes, a shelter at the end but also a perilous drop that undoes everything you just did.</p>, <p>I feel like time and the fans will absolve it even of its awkward controls and terrible checkpointing. But in the same way that Dark Souls drop-outs often lament that they cannot explore Lordran in some sort of easy mode, I wish that Rain World was not so obtuse and punishing. Unlike Dark Souls, there’s no real <i>reason</i> behind the difficulty, no sense of purposeful design. And often there is evidence of some terrible design. Why are there poles drawn in the background, in almost exact same hue as the foreground’s ‘usable’ poles? Why does the ‘transition’ point from one screen to another sometimes land in critical areas – during a dangerous jump or (in one case) a winding vertical climb infested by invisible lizards, who snap you up from unseen positions far above the edge of your view. How it expects you to see the creatures before you are even on the next screen, I don’t know. Attention game makers: there is a difference between in being “hands off” and being straight-up neglectful.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rainworld_wit_14.jpg"/></p>, <p>Mostly, the feeling I have come away with is frustration. The philosophy here isn’t “we refuse to hold your hand”. It’s more like: “we are going to cover your hands with lubricant and task you with climbing a fireman’s pole”. The game doesn’t seem to realise that it’s strength <i>isn’t in difficulty</i>, or repeating areas again and again, but in discovery and wandering, in exploration and a sense of wonder.</p>, <p>At 20 hours, having discovered just 8 of the regions, I threw the gamepad aside with a mixture of exasperation and disappointment. There are those who will relish the challenge but I never found the slugcat’s family, and not just because there were no clues or direction as to their whereabouts. There was a big part of me that didn’t want to stop playing and maybe I’ll pick it up again some day, because there is so much to love about discovering the laws of nature behind this huge, ruined ecosystem. But with each random death, each accidental roll off a cliffside, each checkpoint drought, that love turned to ash. There is so much beauty and intrigue and diversity of life in Rain World. It’s a pity the game doesn’t want you to see any of it.

Future Unfolding</a> [<a href="http://www.futureunfolding.com/">official site</a>] is a game about discovery and delight. It’s a dreamlike world which encourages you to play with the environment as you feel out how to make progress through the foresty wilderness. At its best it lets you learn how to progress without feeling like you’re being taught or led. But I also noted times when that feeling of exploration and play fell away and I ended up hugging the walls of an area, combing the trees for a missed pathway or point of interaction. So I cannot give an unequivocal recommendation, but as the game benefits so much from players going in knowing as little as possible I’m hoping this introduction gives you a sense of whether you might enjoy it. </p>, <p>The full WIT is after the jump…<span id="more-437049"></span></p>, <p>Still here? Then onward into the nitty gritty!</p>, <p>Future Unfolding is a top-down game where you gradually explore a forest world. At first you’re wandering basic terrain, discovering that you can interact with objects by pressing the spacebar or by walking or running. Thus you’ll start to note the low-pitched blooping which means your character is running through pebbles, or the strange bubbling when you activate a bush that teleports you to a different area. I found myself playing a lot in this part of the game – not playing in the general sense of just moving through the game, but playing in that delighted way where you interact with things just to see what happens, or to revel in the sensation of performing the action.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J3Yyw2oK8kk" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>After a while the novelty fades and I wondered what else there is to do in the world. Is this it?</p>, <p>And then I reached a slope and found myself in amongst the trees which were previously confined to an area I could see but had assumed was just for decoration around the borders of the pathways! And you can hold down the button to run and shove your way THROUGH the treeline instead of it being secretly a wall. And THEN your shoving and rustling dislodges a flock of BIRDS! </p>, <p>Future Unfolding is very much about feeding you these moments and expanding the scope of your interactions gradually. There’s a broader narrative at play which guides your exploration to a certain degree – you’re wobbling and wimbling your way across these half-curated, half-procedurally generated lands to get to other areas and activate new… spikey cloud orb things and stand on dream wolves so that they dispense a kind of vague spiritual wisdom/vague spiritual questioning. </p>, <p><img alt="Future Unfolding" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/future2.jpg"/></p>, <p>That’s the part of the game I was less engaged by. It doesn’t disrupt the flow of the experience, it just reorients it a bit so your wilderness exploration seems intended more as a kind of vision quest. That’s supported by a kind of heightened consciousness aesthetic – maybe playing a little with synaesthesia – present since the start of the game. You leave behind a colourful trail as you run, for example and the way sound effects seem heightened or expanded is easily illustrated with the blooping rocks. </p>, <p>That’s interesting, but the text snippets dispensed by some of the creatures you encounter tipped into meaningless philosophy-adjacent wiffle for me and I started skim-reading them or making my character run around while they were playing out. Taken as a whole body of text, they delineate a kind of folk tale or mythos for the world and its inhabitants but the less specific it got, the more the dreamlike vagueness felt like ambiguity without depth. </p>, <p>Here’s a video to show a stretch of gameplay – as I say, spoilers because the game is about discovering this stuff, but it’s also blooming difficult to convey any of the atmosphere without movement or sound!</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaaafbkAM2I" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>I think the game works better when you’re interacting and discovering through play rather than through language. The moment I realised what the presence of trees might “mean” (I don’t want to get too specific, but there is a moment where the presence of a lot of trees takes on a lot of potential significance) is done with a really deft touch. The exact meaning, if there is one, is left ambiguous and that works far, far better than the information offered up by the animals. They weren’t bad, exactly, because there were touches of storytelling which were really pleasant or which helped build the sense of the world but there were a few bum notes. </p>, <p>Another slight disruption to the flow is that playing on a keyboard means it’s easy to travel up, down, left and right or diagonally, but the way the narrow paths wind means you’re often getting caught on the walls. It’s not a major disruption or anything, but it means the controller option is infinitely preferable just because of the smoothness it would hopefully facilitate. That said, I couldn’t get the game to recognise my 3rd party Xbox controller so I’m not sure that it definitely does change the movement that way. </p>, <p><img alt="Future Unfolding" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/future1.jpg"/></p>, <p>A last criticism became more striking the further through the game I got. The areas which mark each level or world or zone or whatever you want to call them are surprisingly large. That’s a lovely thing the first time you realise it, but at some points I just couldn’t see the way ahead. At that point the game swings from being about exploration and discovery to open up new paths and more about skirting the edges of every area checking for things I have missed in terms of exits or interactive objects. </p>, <p>Sometimes the problem was that I’d not found the solution to a puzzle, sometimes it was just that I hadn’t combed the map thoroughly enough. Both are problematic in their own way. </p>, <p>When my progress was hampered by a puzzle I hadn’t seen the solution to, that felt oddly unpleasant. I mean, I like puzzles. I play very frustrating puzzle games and enjoy that frustration. Here it doesn’t work the same way for me because the game sort of lulls you into a playful space where you tinker and potter and run and then occasionally you bash into an obstacle and have to figure it out with a different bit of your brain. </p>, <p><img alt="Future Unfolding" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/futureunfolding4.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s like wandering home after a pub trip on a summer evening and the world is fuzzy and lovely and OOH A FROG! and then suddenly the frog needs you to snap out of that fuzziness and solve a puzzle otherwise it won’t let you go home.</p>, <p>Sometimes the thing gating your progress is clear and you need to snap into that different mode of thinking, but sometimes it isn’t. Did you not realise a puzzle was a puzzle or did you just explore a previous segment in such a way that you managed to avoid finding a vital cave or bush or exit?</p>, <p>That’s where the retracing of the steps begins. I got into the habit of exploring an area by skirting the edges of the forest, hugging the rock walls to make sure I hadn’t missed anything there and then exploring within. It’s a very different thing to the earlier mindset of running about and converts the experience from something freeform to something more mired in functionality or completionism. That feels wrong here. </p>, <p>It didn’t ruin the game or anything, but it did mean that by the end I felt like I’d stopped discovering and started trawling which, in turn, dulled my emotional investment.</p>, <p><img alt="Future Unfolding" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/futureunfolding5.jpg"/></p>, <p>I’m not sure how to sum this up for a review, truth be told. I have notes written from early on when I was brimming over with excitement and wonder and I’m pulling them together having lost that sense of connection with the game in its later stages. I think I would have felt differently if I’d played as a non-reviewer and walked away when I felt that interest wane instead of ploughing onward. The £14.99 price tag makes it harder to say “just take a punt on it” but I want to make sure I stress just how lovely and uplifting the discovery section was. I also want to highlight that the semi-proc gen element of the game’s level construction might mean you get a different result in terms of knowing how to move forward.</p>, <p>I think the best I can offer is that if you like the kinds of games I like (and you can get a sense of that through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/author/pipwarr/">my author tag</a>) I think you will like and value this.

Kôna</a> [<a href="http://www.konagame.com/">official site</a>] feels like a game that admirably comes in the wake of Campo Santo’s wilderness wonder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/Firewatch/">Firewatch</a>. But it’s worth noting the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studioparabole/kona-a-survival-adventure-game/">Kickstarter</a> for the game launched years before Firewatch released. Still, I suspect lessons have been learned and added in the last year, and they’re very welcome, as this proves to be a fascinating game.<span id="more-436887"></span></p>, <p>Rob Zacny <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/03/14/kona-review-early-access/">took a look at the Kickstarted project</a> last year during its early access, but much has changed since and now it’s out for real. I’m really pleased to report it’s well worth a look. And, as I always seem to be saying as I launch into these reviews, if you want the experience as I had it – going in completely blind, knowing nothing other than it was a scripted adventure using the techniques of survival games – then take my word for it that it’s a top-notch experience with a slightly damp ending. Otherwise, I’ll give away a little bit more context below because to not do so would make it impossible to talk about in any depth.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/kon3.jpg"/></p>, <p>Set in late 1970, a private detective called Carl Faubert is called to a small Northern Canadian village in the middle of the wilderness by a local businessman. The case seems odd – one W. Hamilton has requested that he investigate a case of vandalism, which is hardly his usual territory. On arrival, Faubert is involved in a car accident, and after coming around at his wheel discovers the other driver has run from the scene, and heavy snow has fallen along with terrible cold. Too cold to be out and about when injured post accident, certainly. And so kick in your survival game instincts: look for equipment, figure out some first aid, and get your car working again.</p>, <p>That’s the first sign that something’s different here. Pretty much none of the eternally early access survival sims give your character a working automobile. Faubert, armed with a road and trail map of the area, is going to need it however, if he’s got any chance of trying to find help, shelter and warmth.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/kon4.jpg"/></p>, <p>From this point on you’re afforded a really impressive amount of freedom for a game that’s so tightly scripted in terms of where it’s heading. Progress beyond where it wants you to reach is blocked off, but in a satisfying, narratively justified way, and in my experience the choices I made seemed to rather perfectly match the ideal order in which to encounter everything. Perhaps I got lucky, or perhaps the game used subtle and not-so-subtle direction to push me into picking the right fork in the road – it’s obviously hard to tell. Either way, it worked splendidly, and I was very gladly funneled down its pathways.</p>, <p>So much looks like it plays like, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/the-long-dark/">The Long Dark</a>, with buildings to find and enter, explore, loot, and shelter inside. Getting a fire lit is absolutely essential if you’re going to keep Faubert alive, and he’s going to need tools, a hammer, a crowbar, and most importantly, light. However, he’s not going to need food and drink, and there you’ll see the biggest step away from the traditions of the genre it’s more aping than following. Because this takes place over a single day and night, and because normal humans outside of video games don’t need to eat a seven course meal every 45 minutes, you’re just fine when it comes to sustenance.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/kon6.jpg"/></p>, <p>Quickly the story escalates into a murder mystery (because let’s face it, a vandalism investigation might not have been the most riveting story – “It was him.” “Okay.”), then there’s the matter of these strange glowing ice formations that appear on the ground. And why are the local wolves acting so strangely?</p>, <p>Something odd is happening in this small town, and that rather pleasingly affords you the ability to root through people’s houses, go through all their drawers, and read all their private correspondence. Who doesn’t enjoy that? And as you go, Faubert keeps detailed notes in his notebooks, collating the gathered information and helping you put it in order despite discovering it in your own pattern.</p>, <p>This is aided further by the completely sumptuous narration by Forrest Rainier, his mellifluous delivery adding a depth of charm to the story. The only downside of this is a tendency for this commentary to over-explain, especially toward the game’s weaker ending where it culminates in a clumsy exposition dump. (The sort that feels like it should have been more game, but perhaps ran out of time or money or energy. It’s probably relevant that the game was Kickstarted as episodic, but has eventually become a single release.) There are also a few translation issues from the game’s original French, especially with the on-screen text occasionally making little sense. Not a big deal overall, but definitely shows why you should always have a first-language speaker do your proofing whichever language you’re translating to.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/kon7.jpg"/></p>, <p>The game is packed with lovely details, a favourite being the way some descriptive text is written onto the surfaces of the rooms you’re in (although here the translation is at its worst). It also does spooky extremely well, sneaking up on you when you’re not expecting it, with a good few moments that made me laugh out loud at my own reaction. (Not jump-scares, I should add, for those who avoid such things.) Houses are packed with detail about the people who live there, and there’s a strong sense of place about the whole thing.</p>, <p>I do wish the ending didn’t feel so rushed, somehow at once feeling like it explains far too much, and yet resolves far too little. But the journey there is absolutely worth it – this is a narrative adventure that smartly pretends to be a survival game, while not shying away from wanting to tell you its story. It doesn’t have the slick perfection of Firewatch, it’s a rougher game (and again let’s remember it was Kickstarted years before FW was released), but it understands the same ideas that made Firewatch work, and that’s damned important. </p>, <p>It’s tremendous at creating its distinct atmosphere and then drawing you deeper in. It’s witty, spooky, and achieves an ideal sense of urgency. Weird, clamant and intriguing, this is well worth a look.

Every week we warp Brendan into the gaseous caverns of early access to see if he can find precious games worth playing in the gloom. This time, the subterranean space colonisation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/oxygen-not-included/">Oxygen Not Included</a></i><i> </i><i>[<a href="https://www.kleientertainment.com/games/oxygen-not-included">official site</a>]</i></p>, <p>Everything is covered in piss. When I branded my new space colony ‘Yellow Water Station’ I did so because I was prompted to come up with a suitable name for a settlement on the interstellar frontier. But all I could think of was how weird it is that astronauts drink their own recycled and purified urine. ‘Yellow Water Station’ was my puerile attempt at humour. I didn’t expect the new underground village I was building to accept its new moniker with such enthusiasm. Now everything is covered in piss, poisonous red gas is building up in the sleeping quarters, and there’s a dead body at the bottom of one of the aquifers.<br/>
<span id="more-436765"></span></p>, <p>Oxygen Not Included is a management game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/klei-entertainment/">Klei</a>, the people who made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/dont-starve/">Don’t Starve</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/invisible-inc/">Invisible Inc</a>. It’s best thought of as a cartoony galactic disaster waiting to happen. Much is done in the style of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/rimworld/">Rimworld</a> but viewed from a side-on angle. Everything happens below the surface of a distant planet, or possibly an asteroid (at least, I didn’t reach any surface during my upward digging). Three chums are warped in to build and get the party started. As the ‘cycles’ pass more chums will come through the warp gate, which gives you a choice out of three people for the colony. CRUCIALLY, the game allows you to rename all of your colonists. The founders of Yellow Water Station, for example, were a narcoleptic technician called Bumpo Bilgetank, a mediocre chef known as Fran Flan Pan, and Doctor Kill, a yokel physician.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni2.jpg"/></p>, <p>They went about their early days as best as I could manage them. They carved out a home and made a latrine in a separate chamber. They made a food machine that turns dirt and water into horrible green bars of mush that come slowly out of the machine’s orifice when someone turns a crank. To power this source of food they built a battery. But to charge the battery one of them has to physically run inside a generator wheel, like a sad rodent. Bumpo Bilgetank was the technician and therefore the most qualified to periodically run like a hamster for several hours of the day.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni3.jpg"/></p>, <p>After some time they were joined by a miner with a fabulous perm called Digmeister Jones. He made sterling work of a flooded passage by digging while completely submerged in water. He would hold his breath, dig, then escape for air, then go back under for more digging.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni4.jpg"/></p>, <p>Eventually, the water dropped away into a new chamber, already formed by the randomly-generated landscaped. “This,” I thought triumphantly, “shall be our sleeping den!” Within four days we had blocked up the chamber again. It had filled with carbon dioxide. Digmeister Jones slept now on the floor of the latrine.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni5.jpg"/></p>, <p>Like in many periods of my life, gas is a big issue. Here, the game simulates the passage of gases around your colony’s chambers. Light gases float, heavy gases sink, they all mix and wander in whatever way science dictates and you can view them more easily on a special screen (see below). When you first warp in, there are some rocks that magically produce oxygen. But those dissolve quite quickly, meaning you’ve got to build machines and research new methods of making the underground air breathable. The colonists at Yellow Water set up two large machines that would turn algae (found on the walls of caverns and buried among the rock) into sweet, sweet O2. Later, we would turn to more <em>ambitious</em> methods of oxygen-producing.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni6.jpg"/></p>, <p>Suffice to say, the bulk of the appeal here is in trying to manage all the different gases (and liquids) that plague your colonists. Carbon dioxide, hydrogen, contaminated oxygen – all of them are a threat in some way and you will have to research new tools and constructions to deal with them. Gas pipes, pressure valves, air filters, generators, vents, airlocks. You’ll be building all of these in a vainglorious attempt to finally tame mankind’s greatest nemesis – air itself. You might succeed. The people of Yellow Water did not.</p>, <p>The team built new beds in an upper chamber following the loss of the lower chamber, which would remain a forbidden zone for the rest of my time as a space manager. They made enough cots for themselves and some new recruits that had warped into the caverns in the meantime. But this room too was becoming stifled. I needed more oxygen production. I turned to the glory of a machine called an electrolyzer, which we dipped into the surface of the water and powered with a separate battery and hamster wheel.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni7.jpg"/></p>, <p>It worked! Precious oxygen was pumping out of it and making the bed chambers slowly more comfortable. But then I saw the other by-product. Hydrogen.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni8.jpg"/></p>, <p>The red gas rose, lighter than the oxygen, and got trapped in pockets in the ceiling. I had an idea. I quickly ordered the colony to dig a tunnel, slightly upwards, into another off-site chamber, where the hydrogen could flow. But this could only be a stopgap. The electrolyzer didn’t produce its gases constantly (only when the air pressure of the surroundings deemed it possible) but it did now and again splutter enough hydrogen into existence to become a growing concern. Meanwhile, by the warp gate, Digmeister Jones couldn’t reach the toilet in time and wet himself in front of two of the colony’s newest recruits.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni9.jpg"/></p>, <p>These problems, both the red gas slowly building up in a rocky pocket and the hot urine dripping down into the kitchen, were a sign of things to come.</p>, <p>But what we needed more urgently, I thought, was a means of dealing with carbon dioxide. A machine that could magically remove it from the air was still too far off on my research tree. But browsing the available options I fancied that I discovered a much better solution. I was going to create a slime farm.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni11.jpg"/></p>, <p>You see, at this point I had the tech to create a bio distillery, which would convert slime (mined from the walls like any other ‘block’) into algae. With that I could create algae mounds – these look like heaps of compost but instead of creating fertilizer they slowly convert CO2 into oxygen. Don’t worry about the details, just know that I did the maths. Fifteen algae pots will produce as much oxygen as one of the electrical O2 machines I currently have hooked up. But, significantly, each algae pile will not use electricity and once they are all combined they will consume <em>less than half</em> of the algae a machine would over the same time. Sustainability, ho!</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni10.jpg"/></p>, <p>We got digging. I say “we”. I mean I ordered everyone else to dig. Once the slime farm was complete, I would be able to decommission the electrolyzer and put a stop to its treasonous red gas. A relief, because right now I am continually distracted from my tasks in order to build new chambers to where the hydrogen can freely flow. Eventually, the plan is to disassemble the electrolyzer, trap the hydrogen behind an airlock, and then simply forget all about the pocket of dangerous highly explosive gas. I’ll put up a do not enter sign. It’ll be fine.</p>, <p>But it is easier to say “slime farm” than to make “slime farm” a reality. The bio distillery – the integral piece of equipment to the whole endeavour – needed more room than I thought, and also produced waste water that was contaminated. In an attempt to pump this contaminant into a nearby aquifer that was already green with toxicity, I ordered the chums to breach the intervening rock wall and install an outlet pipe as quickly as possible. The runoff would flow into a separate ditch, where it would be caught and contained. Then the wall and ditch would both be plugged again. It would last only a few minutes, I reasoned. That won’t do much harm. Here is a picture of Fergus Fungusmeyer and Doctor Kill waist deep in filthy water, installing the drain pipe.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni12.jpg"/></p>, <p>As you can see, Doctor Kill has become infected with “The Spores”. Don’t worry, he’ll recover. Much worse is the effect opening this toxic gap has had on the air quality of the colony. Every chamber is soon filled with contaminated air. Everyone spends the next handful of days choking on a green miasma.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni13.jpg"/></p>, <p>Even as they sleep, the stink pervades everything and spreads disease with it. Fran Flan Pan is the only one awake tonight. She needs the toilet but it is too full of human waste and she needs to plunge it. Life is terrible here. Why does anyone agree to come to Yellow Water?</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni21.jpg"/></p>, <p>The miasma eventually faded after I installed some air purifiers all over the place. The slime farm also became functional but I had only built fifteen of the thirty algae piles I wanted. I considered decommissioning the electrolyzer now. But as I again browsed the new technology we’d been developing a new idea came storming ferociously into my head.</p>, <p>“What if we made this hydrogen generator?”</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni14.jpg"/></p>, <p>And lo, it came to pass that the colony got its most powerful electrical generator yet. It took me a good amount of time to figure out the intake pipes, output pipes, air filters, vents, and pressure valves required to piece it all together. But by the end we had a great source of ‘leccy. All it needed was the hydrogen from below to rise. And because of the way I had wired it, it only needed a person to come and spin the wheel to get it started. As long as the hydrogen kept flowing, it could run without human intervention indefinitely. A bigger version of the battery was keeping the energy stored and, as good levels of clean oxygen flowed among the populous, life in Yellow Water seemed, for a moment, to be good.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni15.jpg"/></p>, <p>Then, the slime crisis. The bio distillery ran out of slime. One by one, the algae piles dried up. Oxygen levels would soon be dropping to dangerous levels. I ordered the colony, now numbering a hearty eleven people, to dig for more slime.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni16.jpg"/></p>, <p>But the slime crisis was accompanied by the hydrogen crisis. A venting mistake (whoops) had caused huge amount of hydrogen to leak into the sleeping quarters. To make matters more unstable, the hydrogen crisis preceded the most troubling thing to happen to Yellow Water yet. The great piss crisis.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni17.jpg"/></p>, <p>Sure, it’s <em>possible</em> we could have avoided the great piss crisis of cycle 30. Critics may suggest that installing more than a single functional toilet for eleven people would have been a good first step. Reducing stress by decorating the place or providing massage tables might also have helped. Providing the colony with more than one tiny lamp probably would have allowed people to navigate the settlement more happily and more easily, without say, wading through an ankle deep puddle of human urine. But those critics were not there. They know nothing of the demands of managing a space colony. It was very difficult that cycle and in the subsequent cycles. I had to order a lot of mopping up.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni18.jpg"/></p>, <p>Sadly, the mopping was doing little to stop the failure of the colony. All these crises culminated and Yellow Water soon descended into absolute piss carnage. Stress levels among the colonists sky-rocketed and a man called Grub began to vomit from the anxiety of living in such a stinking yellow hell. Snores O’Duggan, a man who slept apart from everyone else because he snored so loudly that it kept the others awake all night, began to destroy batteries throughout the colony in a blind rage, systematically disabling filters, air pumps, the distillery and the mush machine. Even in the dark and quiet nights, piss dripped down from the sleeping quarters, going from level to level before finally getting into the water supply.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni19.jpg"/></p>, <p>Bumpo Bilgetank was the first casualty of those terrible times. He died while I wasn’t looking. I don’t know anything about it. But it <em>seems</em> that as I made busy decisions with pipes and the mop, he had been digging for much-needed slime and had fallen into a deep pit of contaminated water, where he subsequently drowned. He fell from a great height, perhaps slipping on the cocktail of urine and vomit that had accumulated at the mouth of the pit. Whatever the case, Yellow Water had suffered its first loss. One of the original founders had died. At the time of his death, said the game, he had been furious with stress.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/o2ni20.jpg"/></p>, <p>That’s when I left Yellow Water Station. A manager can’t be expected to fix everyone’s problems. Critics (<em>damned critics!</em>) might say this is the height of irresponsibility and that at the very least I should see out the development of the new latrines I started. Or that I should take urgent note of the food shortage that was quickly developing. Or that I ought to explore more of the research tree, with its refrigerators and showers and liquid filters and new-fangled overhead lights. But those critics don’t have deadlines to meet. I’ve got other things to do!</p>, <p>Yet I’m sure, given the systems and silliness already on offer in Oxygen Not Included, that other space managers can and will be found. It doesn’t quite have personality and drama on par with Rimworld’s pawns and emergencies but it is certainly on the right track. Anyone who fancies some disgusting, gas-based lunacy will find something to like about the cartoon caverns here. As for me, I’m done taking the piss.

Nier: Automata</a> [<a href="http://www.niergame.com/agegate.php">official site</a>] is unpredictable, from beginning to end(s). </p>, <p>What begins as a robot-smashing action game with gargantuan bosses soon becomes an open world RPG, then a bullet hell circus nightmare with confetti and corpses, and then something else entirely. To describe all of the things that Automata encompasses, even in vague terms, would be to spoil its greatest asset: surprise. For that reason, I’ve avoiding the specifics of almost any of the wonderful and horrible things that happen. This is important.</p>, <p>Let’s stick with the basics then. Automata, at its best, fuses Platinum’s mastery of stylish action to a framework that works as both a tour and deconstruction of various genres, and a story both stranger and more interesting than it first appears. It’s <em>awesome</em>.<span id="more-436343"></span></p>, <p>Nier: Automata’s story concerns special forces androids who are sent to the surface of a ruined Earth to try and reclaim it from robots, built by aliens, who are waddling around the place like the mutant offspring of Dusty Bin, R2-D2 and Catchphrase’s Mr Chips. Your task, as YoRHa No.2 Type B (2B) is to follow orders beamed down from an orbital satellite, The Bunker, where the plan to regain control of Earth so that the remnants of humanity, now living on the moon, can go home.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/niera3.jpg"/></p>, <p>Before you even have time to figure out the why and the what, you’re plunged straight in at the deep end though, hacking, slashing and shooting your way through a grim industrial ruin, and getting to grips with the control system. Combat is simple to execute but tricky to master, with light attacks, strong attacks, and lock-on, fire and dodge buttons. 2B doesn’t have a gun but she does have a Pod, a drone thing hovering around her, and it can pew-pew away at enemies from afar. Later, it’s possible to upgrade it with melee attacks, shields and other abilities, but for the opening hour, it’s your ranged option. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/17nier.jpg"/></p>, <p>I’d recommend a controller (PS4 Dualshock for me) for comfort and to avoid the trickiness of twinstick shooting with a mouse and keyboard. It can work well, and I’ve seen it work well elsewhere, but here it’s cumbersome. I haven’t had many issues with the port other than that, though those trying to play in super resolutions might be in for a rough time. On the whole, the PC version is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/17/nier-automata-pc-released-on-steam/">passable rather than powerful</a>.</p>, <p>But with a game this fascinating, it’d be a shame for any platform to miss out, particularly our own home ground. Even in its first hour, which is a little like an extended pre-credits sequence during which the game shows very little of its hand, Automata is a slick if unambitious action game. It’s one of the few games that has made me notice the camera for positive reasons – usually, a game’s camera only draws attention to itself when it’s getting stuck on a character’s arse or elbow, or crashing into a wall, but here the camera is a tool that makes the game malleable. Control of its position is taken away at certain points to reimagine a room as a side-scrolling shooter, a bullet hell arena or an Afterburning arcade flight sim. But with robots.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/niera1.jpg"/></p>, <p>Always with robots. Nier wants to explore every possible angle of automated function and form, and it doesn’t take long for the robots to reveal their secrets. Nothing is quite as it seems and as soon as you’ve figured out one twist in the tale, another clicks into place and it’s not long before you realise that this tale is prehensile and its not just capable of getting a grip on you, it’s rearranging all the pieces of the puzzle as you go.</p>, <p>This goes back to my opening line: Automata is unpredictable. It’s one of the most surprising games I’ve ever played, and I don’t mean that in the sense that monsters spawn in your face when you’d least expect them to. It’s the way that both the story and the action shift from one mood and genre to another as you move along. Much has been written of director Yoko Taro’s eccentricities as a creator, but I’m struck more by a sense of curiosity. If the game does reflect his sensibilities, it speaks more of a mind flitting from one idea to the next, discarding each one as soon as it’s been examined. Despite the grand cohesive plot that runs through multiple playthroughs (Automata doesn’t have New Game +, it has what are effectively entire new chapters to play following your first completion), Nier feels a bit like an anthology of stories, knitted together into something larger.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/niera6.jpg"/></p>, <p>Because most of the game takes place in an open world RPG structure, you’re not harnessed to Taro’s imagination, rushing from one revelation to the next. Instead, you can take your time if you so choose, enjoying what remains of life on Earth by riding moose and boar around the ruins of the world, or collecting crafting materials and doing sidequests. I’m not particularly interested in collecting every glowing piece of kit that appears in the streets, deserts and forests, but I never felt I was being punished for ignoring that side of the game. And sidequests are rewarding both for the character- and world-building they reveal, and because the combat that is a large part of them is excellent.</p>, <p>It doesn’t quite show Platinum at their absolute best, but it’s rare to find an RPG with action so enjoyable. The boss fights show the systems at their best, requiring air-dodges, smashing combos and smart use of your Pod’s powers. Behind all of that is a levelling system that’s both startlingly strange and perfectly fitting. Your android has a set of chips that run everything from elements of the HUD, which you can unplug and disable to make more space for other chips should you wish, to buffs and abilities. Brilliantly, should you want to play through the game as a storytelling exploration piece with minimum swordplay, Easy mode allows you to use chips that automate different aspects of combat. You can attach and remove each of them as you go.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/niera4.jpg"/></p>, <p>You can even remove your character’s OS, but you shouldn’t. Seriously. Don’t do that.</p>, <p>The system essentially makes your character into a modifiable weapon, wielding other weapons that can also be levelled up, revealing their own backstories as they become more powerful. That concept, of the player character as a device for making war, is an integral part of the story, and that’s how Automata works. For all of its genre-hopping and about-turns from tragedy to farce, and sincerity to flippant asides, it rarely fails to tie your actions to its story and themes.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/niera5.jpg"/></p>, <p>I went into Automata expecting weird and came out the other side impressed by how sad, beautiful and strange a game that stars a sexy android can be. I don’t have anything against sexy androids, but I’d been expecting something much sillier, at the zany end of the ‘weird’ spectrum. Instead, Automata surprised me yet again. It’s very sad, very beautiful and very strange. The one major complaint I have is that it can be very brown and dull for extended periods, which suits the sense of a washed-out world, but also makes some locations ultra-bland. If you’re scampering around in them for ages, that’s your choice though. Unless it’s doing something spectacular and dramatic, Automata very rarely forces you to stay in one place for any length of time. </p>, <p>Having unlocked just a few of the endings (some are more like chapter breaks than endings, many are punchlines or small oddities), I feel like I’ve feasted on a ten-course meal. Some of the food turned to ashes in my mouth, but only when that was by design. From its always-magnificent but alternately triumphant and mournful score to its massive intricate bosses and moments of bleak horror, Automata is a superbly controlled game. It gives you freedom to explore, to collect, to fight and to much about, but it always has one hand on the tiller and the other on that camera, directing the action and observing your every move.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/niera2.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s rare to see such ambitious storytelling and open world roleplaying tied to such a stylish combat system, not to mention the (optional) Souls-like multiplayer elements, shooter tangents, mini-games that punctuate rather than interrupting, and that big ol’ world to explore. You don’t need to have played any of Yoko Taro’s previous games to appreciate Automata, even though it has links to both Drakengard and (of course) the original Nier, but it’ll probably make you keen to seek them out. Me? I’m hoping Platinum get a chance to work with these worlds and words again. A thousand ideas, delivered in rapid succession, backed by action that is the thread that stitches everything together rather than an interruption between one story beat and the next.

Here it is! The space game review you’ve all been waiting for on this, Monday the twentieth of March, 2017: Cosmic Express!</p>, <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/cosmic-express/">Cosmic Express</a> [<a href="https://cosmicexpressgame.com/">official site</a>] is an adorable-but-also-rock-solid puzzle game from Alan Hazelden. He’s working with Ben Davis who was his collaborator on RPS favourite, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/12/22/a-good-snowman-is-hard-to-build/">A Good Snowman…</a>, and with Tyu of the Klondike collective. The result is a really satisfying puzzle game where you lay the track for a train in order to transport little alien blobs to their destinations.<span id="more-436259"></span></p>, <p>Right, SO! Basic game rules time: </p>, <p>The play space encompasses a grid of squares inside a space bubble. You can lay track on any of the spaces not occupied by a station or some other obstacle. If the passenger car you pull is empty when it comes alongside a station, the waiting alien blob hops in. If a full passenger car runs alongside an empty box of the same colour as the blob (i.e. the destination) the blob will hop out and set up a little home there. You can’t take the train back over existing track so the main challenge of the game is drawing one continuous line that will enable travelling blobs to all reach their homes before your train chugs off into the next playspace. </p>, <p>Cosmic Express started life as a Train Jam game called Train Braining and elements of that early game still exist but the project has been fleshed out and polished up with a lot of playtesting to help figure out the difficulty curves of the experience. The levels are now organised into little galaxies with Train Braining’s original levels now placed in accordance to their difficulty. After three hours of play I’d opened up seven of the galaxies. </p>, <p>As you progress you’ll unlock extra mechanics – the galaxies are generally themed around each of the new ideas. You also encounter levels at the points where galaxies branch off into new destinations where there are multiple solutions. I don’t mean that in terms of the wiggle room you might get with track placement, although in some levels you can add extra swerves and loops for your train just for the fun of it. The multiple solutions I’m talking about here are the ones where you solve the puzzle in a different way which means your train ends up taking a different exit tunnel out of the space and chuffing off towards a new branch of levels or an alternative galaxy. </p>, <p><img alt="Cosmic Express" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/cosmicexpress2a.jpg"/></p>, <p>Some of the other ideas I’ve encountered as I progressed are trains with room for more than one passenger, warp tunnels which act as a kind of junction so you can cross that same square multiple times, and the delightful green alien blob which joyfully soils the carriage of the train it rides in so that none of the other alien blobs will use it. </p>, <p>Difficulty is a strange one when talking about puzzle games because a lot depends on the player. I mean, you can use statistics and playtesting to figure out the basic difficulty curve, but that won’t rule out a player getting in the zone and slicing through multiple levels in one session like a hot buttered knife through a chocolate teapot. It also won’t rule out a player getting some odd personal mental block and being unable to fathom how to solve a puzzle that involves drawing a straight line down the middle of a grid. </p>, <p>I say this because one of the questions people ask when I talk about puzzle games is “How hard is it?” I often can’t answer helpfully because it depends on how your brain is primed to see different types of connections. Spatial logic is my jam so for me, Cosmic Express is largely straightforward but with some nice difficulty spikes that keep me interested. I’d say that I tend to look at the puzzle for a while before I start and then try to solve it in one go. That’s getting less easy to do and thus the difficulty curve is definitely pulling upwards in general.</p>, <p>As you get deeper into the game you’ll encounter mechanics where you can’t discern how the blobs will react without trying them first. For example, if you run track between two stations, both blobs will try to get in and will bounce off each other and back onto the platforms. Thus you learn that you’ll need to find a way to pick up one without triggering the other. </p>, <p>The only inelegant rule I found so far is that when you do the opposite and take an occupied train carriage between two empty platforms the blob will pick one and exit but you can’t predict which until you’ve tried it. Thus there’s consistency in that the blob will henceforth only get out in that direction if you drive through those two destinations at the same time and can factor that into your solution, but it’s not a broader rule you can apply across the whole game. It’s not a case of always preferring the uppermost option or the one on the right and that unknowable element feels oddly sloppy. It also means that I’ve routed solutions which would have been valid if the blob had chosen to exit in one direction but it chose the other and thus I had to go back to the drawing board. </p>, <p>But that’s not a difficulty curve thing, just a bit of inelegant design. So let’s look at the difficulty curve:</p>, <p>At first that manifested as a wave of solve-it-first-time levels and then I’d encounter something which needed me to think a bit differently about an obstacle or a mechanic. There were a few difficulty spikes within that, too. Those were characterised by multiple attempts at solutions, frustrated mutterings into my current cup of coffee and then leaving them alone for a while so I could try afresh at a later point in time. But now I’m at the edges of the space where you can do that and most of my progress comes as I nibble at the edges of galaxies, making smaller bursts of progress while doing more testing and thinking. </p>, <p>Delphinus 13 is my current nemesis.</p>, <p><img alt="Cosmic Express" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/cosmicexpress5.jpg"/></p>, <p>The easiest point of comparison here is A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build. That’s perhaps unsurprising because it was created by two thirds of the same team, but the thing they have in common is they’re a sort of neat, compact logic cake dressed with a cute, approachable icing. The majority of the slices are bite-sized pieces which slip down quite easily for me but with some of the others you seem to get more cake than icing and you have to work your way through it, turning it this way and that to get it to fit into your puzzle… mouth? That analogy stopped working. But you know what I mean, I hope. Also I’m thinking of going out to get some cake.</p>, <p>Anyway, where was I? Yes. Compact, delightful, slightly wonky in terms of difficulty curves for me and I think overall I preferred A Good Snowman simply because I find the track placement sometimes has a bit too much wiggle room for it to feel entirely neat, whereas rolling the snowballs for A Good Snowman stayed as a very tight experience. But! Cosmic Express is just as delightful to look at, and has a really solid core of puzzling to get your brain around!</p>, <p>ADAM is this review finished? Can I go and see if there’s a Battenberg in the shop? <em>[Ed: yes, but only if you bring me back a slice of carrot cake]

Strap in. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/Mass-Effect-Andromeda/">Mass Effect Andromeda</a> [<a href="https://www.masseffect.com/en-gb">official site</a>] is out on Tuesday in the US, and then because EA still lives in 1987, in Europe on Thursday. I’ve played it for over 70 hours, seen the main ending, and am entirely ready to tell you wot I think. It’s well worth reading <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/14/mass-effect-andromeda-review-opening-hours/">my previous piece on the first few hours</a>, as there’s much there that’s relevant that I’ve not repeated below.<span id="more-436013"></span></p>, <p>Mass Effect Andromeda feels like a game that exists because there needed to be a new Mass Effect game. It’s hard, as deeply as you explore it, to find something that shows any other reason for it to be. Despite the extraordinary opportunity of a fresh start, fresh characters, and even a fresh galaxy to set it in, this feels like a lengthy rehash of what came before. It is bad in many ways, from its madcap AI, poor character faces, dated design and most of all, horrible writing, but its biggest crime is just how unavoidably, all-encompassingly dull it is for so, so many hours.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/23ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>There is an odd phenomenon, however. I’ve played for something like 75 hours. I was being thorough, focusing on what to me seemed the most important tasks, but endlessly drawn into side quests and mini-adventures. And yet there is a wealth of game remaining, even after the official ending. It let me do that, play the way I picked (or, as the case really was, the most bearable way), and that’s a huge achievement, something very rarely seen outside of Bethesda games. And in that time, I found what I enjoy in Mass Effect Andromeda, the aspects of an utterly enormous game that let me have some fun. Qualified fun, fun incessantly interrupted by bugs and irritations, mistakes and the unceasing misery that is its turgid, sophomoric writing. But some fun.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/26ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>This is the story of the inhabitants of the Milky Way venturing to a new galaxy. A group of one hundred thousand or so members across five races (Human, Turian, Asarian, Salarians and Krogan) making the extraordinary trip across dark space to go somewhere completely new. A six hundred year cryo-frozen journey, to explore what might be. It is, in its concept, so massive, so wonderfully bursting with possibility, so hugely exciting. It is, in delivery, just about as unambitious an approach to the idea as you could think of.</p>, <p>This tale of discovering Andromeda – or at least the Hellius cluster within it – is populated by some cardboard cut-outs from a science fiction display stand. Rubber-masked baddies (with the least scary-looking big bad of all time), an astoundingly familiar alien race, and – just to ensure no originality could slip in through a crack beneath the door – an ancient, mysterious and technologically accomplished missing race (with a peculiar love for airport puzzle books).</p>, <p>Think about a new galaxy, a whole new potential of life forms, of evolutionary exoticism, of astounding new ideas. Now discard them all and think of intensely familiar bipedal people living in ordinary cities with ordinary thoughts, relationships, educations, jobs, and would you believe it, technology exactly on a par with what you just happened to bring with you. Floating octopuses that think in cascading colours? Societies based on amorphous interaction? Ideas better than the ones I’m throwing out? Nope, not a single thing.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/20ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>You are a Pathfinder, either male or female, named Ryder. You gain the title of Pathfinder within the opening moments of the game despite not being qualified or experienced for the role, without it ever being meaningfully explained, and then are immediately treated like the second coming. It is, as best as I can cobble together, a job title for someone who surveys whether planets are suitable for living on, aided by an AI that directly interacts inside your brain. Each of the five species shipped twenty thousand souls, and one Pathfinder and one AI, called SAM. Except when your human ark shows up, you crash into a strange space anomaly that’s twisted throughout the cluster known as the Scourge. It wasn’t there on your magic quantum telescopes when you left, but (and I’m not being facetious here, this genuinely is the plot) no one thought that things might change on planets over the course of six bloody centuries. Things changed, and the galaxy isn’t as you were expecting, the planets aren’t suitable for habitation, and before you turned up the people who set off early to establish the nu-Citadel, the Nexus, had a big falling out and an awful lot of them were exiled.</p>, <p>As if that weren’t drearily inevitable enough, there’s also a race of cartoon baddies called the Kett, whose grumpy gnarled faces ensure you realise they’re bad, who shoot at you on sight for no reason (in fact, against all reason when you learn more of their nefarious plans) wherever you go. Oh, and just in case this didn’t feel like all the other Mass Effects, there’s ancient alien tech on all the planets that just might help. Off you go.</p>, <p>The AI, SAM, is an invention of your father’s, and is a key aspect of the game. You and he communicate all the time, and you are required to use a scanner all the time, with SAM adding colour commentary on what you see. So of course the matter of AI becomes a crucial one in the story, what with AI having been banned in the Milky Way, and people very nervous of it now after their experiences of the Geth.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/17ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>Let’s talk about the combat as this is going to be a very negative review of a very mediocre game, and the combat is almost great.</p>, <p>You can choose to focus on three aspects, combat, tech and biotics, which correspond to fighting, mechanics and magic. Each has its own (samey) skill tree and you can put abilities together in groups of three, and then switch between the groups on the fly. I began by putting everything into biotics, but then running out of uses for skill points there (when you’ve maxed out an ability, it’s a waste of time really to start on another that does almost the same) and so have improved the passive skills in the other sections. I focused on pistols, sniper rifles and biotic Pull and Throw, which can be used together for fun combos.</p>, <p>In play, this works out like any other third-person action game really, except with the ability to blast baddies into the sky for entertainment. Headshots, ducking in and out of cover, sitting back and letting rival enemy groups beat each other up for a bit… You know the score, and it’s all delivered well enough. It’s nothing exciting, but it entertains in the same way Far Cry does. Clear out a camp, run in and scoop up the loot, and most likely find a new collectable that’ll build into yet another side quest. It’s only thwarted by the completely appalling team AI.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/09ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>Companion AI is a disaster, most distinctly because it’s so incessantly noticeable. You want your buddies to just be there, trotting behind you until fighting starts. Instead they are bonkers, darting back and forth as if chased by wasps, and have the most wonderful/ridiculous need to climb on top of things. Just stand in a room looking at a computer terminal and your buddies will jump up onto cupboards, beds, desks, whatever they can find. More than anything, they take this most difficult path on offer. Why run down some stairs when they can jump over a railing behind some crates, then have to run in an enormous circle around a building to find you again?! It’s definitely amusing, but bloody stupid. And when they react to their self-imposed obstacle courses by letting out terrified grunts, it’s also damned annoying.</p>, <p>But get into battle and it’s much more serious. I cannot tell you how often they just run in front of you and stand still, screwing up shots, bumping you out the way, not shifting out of cover you need, or ignoring enemies immediately in front of them. They <em>can</em> be a help, and when it works it’s fun to see them using their abilities to kill off enemies, but they’re just as likely not to.</p>, <p>Enemy AI is clumsy, but isn’t it always, and this only becomes more problematic when – say – the giant robot you’re trying to kill is entirely encased by a small hill, somehow able to still shoot at you. But so goes this clearly unpolished mess of bugs.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/22ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>It cannot be understated just how much there is of this game. And not just in the way it’s a big stack of explorable maps smothered in icons (thanks Ubisoft for your contagion sweeping through all of gaming), but in the way that there’s recorded dialogue in what must be unprecedented quantities, more side quests than every other game in history put together, and a genuinely impressive variety in ways to play. There’s charging about in your six-wheeler over planets, uncovering enemy encampments, having cover-based shoot-outs. There’s exploring ancient temples of the Remnant. There’s chatting with absolutely everyone you come across. There are lengthy missions (that play out like raids) in special locations. There are (optional) multiplayer games tied into the main plot. And there’s trying to do sex on everyone you encounter.</p>, <p>What unites all these different features is the most unrelentingly dull writing, cliches and aphorisms pouring out like the waterfalls they’d use as an analogy in this sentence. Every chat lasts three times longer than it needs to, and they’re achingly boring from casual encounters to the deepest moments in relationships. I cannot explain this better than by giving a lengthy example from one moment in the first few hours, a chat about the potentially complex and messy subject of faith.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/12ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>One member of your crew, a scientist, reveals to you that she believes in God. Now, this is old territory for Mass Effect, where in the first game you had a right-wing Christian on your crew, and it was handled especially well. Not so this time! This is genuinely the conversation:</p>, <p>“Just all of it. So alien. A constant reminder of the divine intelligence behind all creation.”</p>, <p>“Divine intelligence? A god?”</p>, <p>“Yes, I believe in a higher power. I know it’s a little odd. But I’m a scientist because science brings me closer to something greater than myself.”</p>, <p>To this you are given two possible responses. Beyond all credibility, they are:</p>, <p>“I feel the same way.”<br/>
Or<br/>
“There’s no higher power.”</p>, <p>What the hell? You’re given the choice of either emphatically agreeing that you too believe in God, or you rudely tell a woman you barely know that her faith is bullshit. Honestly, I was tempted just to walk away from the game than be forced into picking one of those two answers. But I went for the former, since at least it wasn’t rude, and I was trying to flirt with her anyway. She expresses her pleasure that someone else agrees that it’s possible to believe in science and God at the same time, and then in what must be one of the worst lines of dialogue in gaming history, your character’s option of a flirting reply is:</p>, <p>“You definitely have an interesting perspective on the interplay between faith and science.”</p>, <p>This isn’t how people speak.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/21ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>This is endemic, permeating from conversations through to grand ideas. Entire races are still described as having a single personality type. “Quick-minded, sharp” someone says of the Angara, as if that’s going to be a common trait across an entire sentient species. A single philosophy is attributed to the entire species, across multiple planets, as if no one would disagree, ever, across space and time.</p>, <p>Giant decisions sproing out of nowhere, with no warning. You’re just idly clearing out yet another identikit ‘dungeon’, and then suddenly you’re asked to decide if you should kill a bunch of innocent people for some potential wider benefit. There’s no flow, no sense of history, just bonkers false choices when a nuanced response would be far more valid (and in BioWare games, previously optional).</p>, <p>There is, as ever, the one crewmate who doesn’t want to talk to you. Who you have to win over by, er, waiting. But this time they’ve ingeniously picked the character from a race who incessantly go on about how they don’t hide their feelings. He won’t talk to you, won’t say why. Everything feels this inconsistent, people explaining their reasons for not liking other people like primary school children, all spats and no sophisticated moral reasoning. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/14ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>Perhaps most significantly, they made the bold decision to remove good/evil responses that have been a mainstay of the developers’ RPGs, but they’ve failed to replace them with anything close to as meaningful. As a result, they’ve essentially removed the majority of choice at all. At one point you’re offered an extremely significant deal that contains an element that’s tantamount to extortion. In any other BioWare game before you’d argue this, perhaps choose it as the lesser of two evils, or reject it based on principle. Here you get two choices: to accept it, or accept it while making a joke. It’s quite bizarre how far they’ve gone in removing the illusion of autonomy, while still seeming to think they’re offering dialogue choice.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jIh1RpbsSf4?ecver=1" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>Of all the Mass Effect games to take away the opportunity to be a dick to your crewmates, boy did they pick the wrong time. Having spent dozens and dozens of hours in their company, I can tell you that I neither like nor dislike any of them. I pretend to dislike Liam and Gil, because both are presented as cock-er-nee blokey-blokes, and it’s ghastly, so I try to pick responses that will upset them, but there’s barely anything that could and nothing interesting comes of it.</p>, <p>I’ve never before played a BioWare game where I wasn’t torn about who to take with me in a landing party. Those moments of, “Oh no, but I <em>have</em> to take X on this trip because it’s his home planet, but that means I will miss Y! There’s not even a glimmer of it. I resentfully take two along, not caring what either will add. It’s so, so odd.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/11ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>Let me give another example that’s emblematic of almost every aspect of the writing: there’s one sidequest on Eos where you find a message from a dude who died in the middle of doing a job, planting radio beacons in various hard-to-reach places. So your task is to finish the job for him, out of respect. With each beacon you place, a message automatically plays, an adult woman’s voice saying empty aphorisms about what a good job her dad is doing. Right, you think, so his daughter recorded him these messages, so she’s probably dead – where is this going to go?</p>, <p>Where it goes is the shocking revelation that – oh no! – she’s dead! And from this we’re asked to feel an emotional response, with your companions leadenly explaining that it’s emotional, you see. Meaningless platitudes from a dead daughter playing out as you complete the task of a dead father. It’s an embarrassment, as if saying, “SOMEONE IS DEAD, SO THERE IS SADNESS!” is how it works. It could have been handled delicately, the messages could have been subtle, messages of genuine complicated love between a father and daughter, a short story playing out as you learn of their trials and their grief. That he never got to hear these messages from his dying daughter should have been the hook, should have tugged at the player, played on our own emotional attachments to parents and children. Instead, as with every part of the game’s writing, it was flat, perfunctory and robotic.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/00ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>Much has been made of issues regarding facial animation, but much of the time faces can look great. Non-human faces. Humans they did not get right. The whole game is this weird flip-flop between gorgeous and ugly, sometimes showing you incredible vistas in detailed scenes, other times awkward greys and blues with boring boxes. Some characters look amazing, others look drawn in crayon. Sometimes special effects are dazzling, other times embarrassing. It’s certainly not Frostbite at its best. But sometimes it can look really lovely.</p>, <p>The bugs, oh there are many. I’ve had Ryder get stuck in a star jump pose, and skid around like a paper doll. I’ve had to quit and restart because conversations couldn’t be left. Characters talk over each other ALL the time, making it impossible to hear key information – and more egregiously, companions will sometimes suddenly start reminding you about an active quest, cutting off the new information to which you’d been listening. I’ve fallen through floors, been killed by rocks (see above), am constantly told there’s something to scan when there’s nothing to scan, have characters loop vital conversations, and Ryder nearly always clips and gets stopped when trying to run up a flight of stairs… </p>, <p>Then add to that a litany of irritants. For example, on an ice planet, every <em>single</em> time you step away from a heater SAM says, “Pathfinder, the temperature is dropping,” or variants thereof, and then when you pass the next one, “Pathfinder, the temperature is stabilising, life support systems at 100%”. Non-stop! Every ten seconds he says one or the other! On so many different planets! And then every time you drive past something you can mine… He DOES NOT SHUT UP.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/02ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>And you can’t just get back on your ship any more. It has to take off from the planet you’re on, even if you just want to check your bloody email (apparently multitools still can’t manage this feat), which involves watching two tedious unskippable cutscenes then two more to land to carry on where you were. Add that to the glacial planet scanning (because everyone LOVED that in Mass Effect II, right?!) and it makes for an annoying game.</p>, <p>I mentioned in my last article about how atrocious is the UI, and it bears repeating. It’s awful in every imaginable way, bewilderingly so. Menus are miserable to navigate, and often barely functioning. When looking through the codex or quest journal or inventory to find newly added content, it’s (usually) marked with a blue tick. Which would be helpful if it weren’t designed as to not let you see them. Anything past the first six entries is off the bottom of the scrolling list, but the act of scrolling highlights each entry, and highlighting them removes the !. As you scroll down to find what’s been slotted in new, it unmarks itself before it appears on screen. That’s bewildering, and makes the reams of content even more unnavigable. And when you’re trying to find new quests in the massive shopping lists, infuriating.</p>, <p>Then there are the exclams that won’t disappear, the ones that are marked in the tab but don’t appear anywhere in the lists within, the ones that aren’t marked on a sub-heading… it’s a mess.</p>, <p>When shopping or crafting you can compare weapons to what you’re currently holding, but not armour to what you’re currently wearing. When crafting you can either have everything you can currently craft from every category lumped together in one enormous list, or lists of everything craftable in a category which doesn’t highlight what you can currently craft. New items like augmentations or blueprints aren’t added to the tops of lists, but rather slotted in all over the place, and thus the scrolling-deleting-the-exclams issue renders these useless as well… It just goes on and on.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/06ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>So there are two big problems. A game that’s somewhere between unpolished and unfinished, and a game that’s just flat and unoriginal and uninspired. There’s the ability to wile away many hours cleaning icons from maps, and it’s worth noting that I lost myself in this multiple times, but in these surroundings, not worth celebration. It’ll keep you busy, but not in a way that feels like you used the time well.</p>, <p>Is it as bad as my previous comments on the first few hours suggested? Kind of, yes, but diluted down by sheer volume of busywork. There’s nothing I’ve found that redeems its crappy writing, threadbare companions, moribund story, and ghastly UI. But, well, the best I can say is it occupies time. The driving’s kind of fun, with its own list of annoyances. Um. Some it’s fine.</p>, <p>Which is frustrating, because dammit, I wanted a wonderful new Mass Effect game, and such a huge amount of effort and work has gone into this. For all its cacophony of flaws, it’s a vast and intricate creation, into which many people have clearly poured huge quantities of energy. To see so much achieve so little is dispiriting in the extreme.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/03ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>Bugs will, I’m sure, be fixed over the coming weeks, and maybe if enough people ask they could ditch the UI and start from scratch on something that works. But it won’t be able to remove that ennui that weighs down so heavily over its formulaic tale, especially after its daft ending.</p>, <p>I’ve a very strong feeling that people are going to buy this anyway, and many will milk from it what they can in order to feel rewarded. That’s great. But as a follow-up to the previous trilogy, it’s a timid and tepid tale too heavily reliant on what came before, too unambitious for what could have been, trapped in a gargantuan playground of bits and pieces to do.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/mea/25ame.jpg"/></p>, <p>Also, who the hell travels to another galaxy and doesn’t bring the Elcor with them?

Pixel Privateers</a> [<a href="http://quadrodelta.com/privateers/">official site</a>] is a lost-in-space roguelikeish that’s focused on interplanetary ground missions and loot-showers rather than interstellar survival. Though its title and appearance suggest cynical faux-retromancy, underneath that mercenary skin there’s plenty going on.<span id="more-435227"></span></p>, <p>Says pixel in the title, has pixel art in the game. Me, I’ve got pixel ennui, but nothing here is objectionable. In fact, the environment art shoots for a bit more detail and is far more attractive than the squat block-head characters. Said characters may be borrowing liberally from other sci-fi too. Was that a Jawa I saw? And I swear I just shot a pack of Borg…</p>, <p>That’s the pixel element done, so now I can natter about the game proper. It’s a team-based, side-on Diablo, only rather than an open map you’re selecting away missions from your spaceship. In between these, you manage a quartet of resources to fund both upgrades and survival, with the emphasis heavily on the former.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G69E8TLiiGI?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>In every mission, you’ll collect a shower of various loot (let’s be honest, if this hadn’t had ‘pixel’ in the title, it would have plumped for ‘loot’), much of which is little more than junk, but some of which gives your team a meaningful offensive or defensive boost. </p>, <p>Others still can actively change one of your unit’s class – not merely allowing you to stick a hammer in her hand and switch a unit from ranged to melee, but also add off-hand items that might make a medic into an engineer or scout. Truth be told, this isn’t a major element of play, as by and large you want to keep every major role filled by someone so will likely just typecast your whole squad, but it means you get to play with pretty much any new toy you might find. There’s a touch of the Borderlands to it, in that you’re regularly getting drops that noticeably mix things up, though mostly for kicks.</p>, <p>You can’t equip new findings or level up until you’ve survived a mission and headed back to your spaceship, at which point it’s a carnival of upgrades. Slap the best new goodies onto your team, spend ability points to improve their aptitude in ye olde strength/agility/stamina/intelligence fayre, and spend ‘research points’ on team-wide bonuses. If that weren’t enough, you also have the option to spend resources on cloning particularly tasty gear or, in an excellent twist, members of your team. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/pp4.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s not strictly necessary as you can recruit externally and rename anyone at any time, but you can use cloning both to save a backup copy of your most treasured squadies (if you’re playing in the optional permadeath mode) and to fill your ranks with the best possible new recruits – exact duplicates of people you already trust. I played one game with a squad composed of only the same person, each with a different number after their name. Granted, their various kit made them all look different on the battlefield, but I was tickled pink nonetheless. I feel that this is an idea that a new XCOM or Syndicate game could make fine thematic use of. </p>, <p>Combat, the main element of Pixel Privateers, is less successful than is the endless tinkering outside of it. Which is to say, it’s mostly a matter of frantic right-clicking, with a bit of hotbar skills action, which can feel pretty brainless. The exception to this is when a given fight, such as against a boss, gets significantly tougher, in which case there’s a tactical pause system whereby you can hit Space and tell your characters exactly what to do rather than simply spam ’em at the nearest enemy.</p>, <p>Sometimes it does actively require this, and if you’re playing on hard mode with permadeath enabled you’ll certainly use it a whole lot more. Though more involved than spamming, I don’t know that I’d go all the way to saying it’s much more interesting. You’re just scrolling through characters and activating their abilities in pause. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/pp1.jpg"/></p>, <p>Mission structures can be tiresome too, such as having to find five specific rooms (not difficult, just requires a bit of trudging) then use your scanner to laboriously find up to five anomalies (the riveting likes of ‘broken pipe’) in each of them. Same goes for, say, freeing three sets of three prisoners. It’s just a looping structure that’s there for the endless quest to level up and find loot. </p>, <p>There are meta-game goals involving finding magic crystals, hopping to new systems and increasing your squad size, and you need to keep a weather eye on your ship’s fuel as it flies between planets, in addition to managing the resources required for buying or cloning new stuff. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/pp3.jpg"/></p>, <p>Most of all, though, Pixel Privateers is shoot’n’loot. It’s playful and polished enough to make its shallowness work – treat it as a while-away-your-time game, not the grand tension of FTL or the exercise in punishing perseverance of Darkest Dungeon. </p>, <p>Pixel Privateers knows exactly what it’s doing, and though it’s about as deep as a microwave lasagne, it’s almost impossible not to lose yourself to it for a few evenings.

We’re currently spoiled for choice when it comes to collectible card games. If you’re not into the traditional nature of the efficient <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/hearthstone/">Hearthstone</a>, you might dip your toes into the monster chess of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/duelyst/">Duelyst</a>, and if you don’t fancy that maybe you’ll swan off with the Gods of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/smite-tactics/">Smite Tactics</a> (although I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/20/premature-evaluation-smite-tactics/">wouldn’t currently recommend it</a>). Into this arena comes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/faeria/">Faeria</a> [<a href="https://www.faeria.com/">official site</a>] a board-game-card-game hybrid that moves slowly and methodically but soon reveals itself to be quietly clever.<span id="more-435311"></span></p>, <p>Here’s the basics: you (intrepid, handsome) and your opponent (untrustworthy, a jerk) face off on opposite sides of a hexagonal grid. It’s all water. Both of you take turns plopping down both bits of land and minions to travel across that land. There are four fountains that continually produce faeria – the magical points that you need to summon things and cast spells – so controlling those is important. But the ultimate goal is to get over there and bash your opponent’s face until they run out of health. The challenge here is that you’re really playing two games at once. A game of territory control and a game of monster murdering. What happens in one will affect the other, and in big ways.</p>, <p>This is because the type of lands you create will determine what kind of cards you can place onto the board and where exactly you can place them. You can’t summon a powerful warrior on your enemy’s hexagons, only on your own. And certain cards need to be placed on the land they call home – green minions on forest tiles, yellow minions on desert tiles, red minions on mountain tiles and blue minions on water tiles (these tiles aren’t the same as the default water underneath everything, they are more like lakes, but many blue minions <i>can</i> swim through an area with no land at all). Likewise, there is a neutral land type along with neutral minions that can be summoned anywhere, so long as the tile belongs to you. You can create two neutral lands in any one turn, whereas special lands (forests, deserts, etc) can only be made one at a time.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/faeriawit2.jpg"/></p>, <p>Because of all this terrain chicanery, decks usually specialise. I’ve been playing mostly as the vegetarian greens, with a deck that focuses on spreading trees quickly and boosting the power and health of my most giant creatures. As soon as I have a good amount of tree tiles on the board, I summon the Oak Father, who gets more health for each forest I own.</p>, <p>Other decks, like the watery blues, focus on summoning lots of frogs who can jump two spaces, lowering the need to place land in certain places, or they might simply be planning to jump over your own troops so that your opponent can place down a sneaky lake in the middle of your turf, an act that wouldn’t normally be possible if the lands themselves aren’t connected. The mountainous reds are all about dealing damage directly to the god (that’s you) and the sandy yellows are all about being super fast, able to charge across multiple spaces at once, but they also like to sacrifice their own creatures to buff others in their ranks.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/faeriawit3.jpg"/></p>, <p>While none of that sounds very unique, there remains the possibility of mixed decks. Or, to put it another way, you can craft a deck that majors in mountains with a minor in lakes, if that’s what you really want. For instance, I’ve seen a foe place down forest after forest only to see him raise a desert out of the blue in the centre of the map – a useful place to spawn windy sand demons that can charge straight at my godly visage.</p>, <p>There are cards that require both a set number from two or more terrain types, such as the Soul Eater, who is stronger from each death over the course of the game and needs both 3 forests and 3 deserts on the board to be summoned. Or the Three Wishes card, which needs two of every land type and nicks three of your opponents cards. It’ll be familiar territory for anyone who has played with the abstract elemental land-currencies of Magic: The Gathering, except this time the territory actually exists.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/faeriawit4.jpg"/></p>, <p>In reality, I didn’t see a lot of mixing and matching, maybe because at lower levels it is easier to stick with a mix of neutral cards and a single colour. But it is certainly possible, and that opens up many more silly combos than would normally be possible.</p>, <p>It’s easy to see Faeria’s strength when compared to other CCGs of its ilk. Where the creators of Duelyst had the audacity to think: “What if we made Hearthstone, but on a board?” the makers of Faeria instead took a look at Magic, and said: “What if we did that, but on a board, but you make the board up as you go, but so does the other player, but also maybe some of the minions can fly or swim through the water?”</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/faeriawit6.jpg"/></p>, <p>On top of that brainwave, there are many small clever elements that roll into the design. For example, instead of simply making a land tile every turn, you have other options, collected in a little panel on the bottom right. This one panel assaults you with choice. You can either:</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/faeriawit7.jpg"/></p>, <p>But you can only do one of these things. Assuming you have a deck that specialises, that means you’ve got four real options here. And there are times when this is paralysing. Do you take the two neutral lands so you can make a rush with this charging Oblivion Rider for your enemy’s faeria well? Do you plant down another Desert so you can summon a Golden Aviary which will empower your flying units? Or do you take an extra mana so you can afford to play the Lord of The Wastes and take out the giant forest monster that’ll be threatening your god next turn? Time is ticking down. I know, draw another card and see what happens. Oh no, that was a mistake.</p>, <p>Each option by itself is a small thing, but by making you choose between them all once per go is something that transforms almost every turn into a critical decision. Eventually, one of you will make the wrong call, or two wrong calls. That’s when things fall apart slowly and messily, like a wet newspaper.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/faeriawit8.jpg"/></p>, <p>The opening is especially important, since your first tendrils of land heading out into the world will signal both your intentions and the cards in your deck. I’ll often pop down two neutral tiles out to the side and summon a Farmer Boy or other weak unit from my opening hand, so he can gather the magical fizzy pop from one of the nearest wells. But then imagine if my opponent suddenly ignores their own wells and sticks two neutral lands coming straight to the centre of the board. Now I’m faced with a dilemma. If I don’t get some buffer between me and those lands, he’ll be able to encroach into my side of the board and spawn there every turn. But if I ignore this land-creep and go for the other well of fizzy pop, I’ll have a much stronger economy than him right off the bat. In this instance, I’d probably panic and draw another card, like a giant idiot man.</p>, <p>My first few games with the AI (there are loads of solo mission packs, puzzles and campaigns) left me pleasantly hooked on all this pinpoint decision-making. Likewise, I had a good time in Pandora mode, a kind of draft mode where both players recieve special treasures that radically change the game by giving you loads more cards or buffing your minions to ridiculous extremes or some other such insanity. But getting into the workaday battle mode and facing off against non-treasured humans I started to feel a certain sluggishness come into the game. Matches can last a long time and much of it can turn into a back and forth of adding together small numbers, until somebody invests too much mana in a single failed rush, or gets their star minion turned into a frog.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/faeriawit9.jpg"/></p>, <p>By the time I had faced off against multiple human wizards I had mixed feelings about it. The creation of your own arena adds a refreshing layer of extra thought to every match, and that little panel with all the choices – land, magic, extra card – really does force some tough decisions. But it suffers from Hearthstone’s old problem. After the opening, a single mislaid volley or simple error can leave you spiralling, totally unable to recover. There are rarely dramatic turnarounds, like in the much speedier Duelyst. When you start to win, you keep on winning, slowly encroaching on enemy territory and making sure there are no holes in your own landscaping decisions. Once you start to lose, it’s like being slowly flushed down a giant novelty toilet. More often than not, you just sit and watch unable to take back those lost wells or make up for that lack of cards.</p>, <p>It’s hugely demoralisng and most of my games – both wins and losses – end with the other player surrendering long before a final blow is even possible. Because you can tell from the swarming enemies, the lack of fizzy-pop, the bad selection of cards, that you lost this game eight turns ago when you mistakenly moved your most important unit into range of a guard with Taunt. Games between those close in skill level, far from being tense and exciting, turn out to be like a match between equally strong soccer teams. Long, boring, ultimately not worth the 90 minutes it took.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/faeriawit5.jpg"/></p>, <p>Pacing issues aren’t it’s only fault. Like most other games of this kind, the free-to-play currency conversion here is not great value for money. While crates full of cards drop generously over your first 20 levels, especially if you indulge the solo missions, the crystals used to craft specific cards are hard to save up and dismantling other cards to get these crystals results in a rubbish return. It feels like walking into GAME and getting 50p for your copy of The Last of Us. The special Steam pack, currently £26.99, feels steep for the contents (10 Battle Chests, 3 Mythic Chests, 3250 Gems and a little gold digger man for 30 days). I splodged some cash on this when it was on sale to see how everything stacked up and I still don’t feel like I got my money’s worth.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/faeriawit10.jpg"/></p>, <p>Despite those reservations, and the sometimes plodding nature of the matches, there’s a lot of brains to Faeria. It’s certainly more interesting to me than vanilla Hearthstone, even if many of its cards lift directly from the big book of CCG mechanics. It’s a game of risk, reward and really bad decisions. It’s many times more thoughtful than Duelyst, which is always my yardstick for card games. But at the same time it is much less climactic, less explosive, and less creative with its minions and their abilities. In other words, if there was a little panel in the bottom right of your screen with all the collectible card games to choose from residing in it, then you’ll probably find your own temperament is going to make the decision for you. Just don’t click ‘draw another card’.

Invent an exciting new games technology. Imagine all the possibilities. New worlds, new forms of interaction, new creativity mediums, maybe even new ways of humans interacting with each other. </p>, <p>Let’s be honest. It’s going to end up being all about guns, isn’t it?</p>, <p>And so it is that Unreal/Gears of War studio Epic’s Oculus Rift-exclusive first-person shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/robo-recall/">Robo Recall</a> [<a href="https://www.epicgames.com/roborecall/en-US/home">official site</a>] joins <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/serious-sam-vr-the-last-hope/">Serious Sam VR</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/superhot-vr/">SUPERHOT VR</a> in the so-far short roster of virtual reality titles I can see myself revisiting relatively often. What these have in common is, of course, face-shooting. I’m not proud, but I did have a bloody good time.<br/>
<span id="more-435005"></span></p>, <p>There’s a lot that’s familiar about Robo Recall, in that many VR shooters seem to be broadly singing from the same hymn sheet despite early speculation that the technology would allow for hitherto undreamed-of ways of interacting with a videogame. This means that Robo Recall, like Serious Sam and to a lesser extent SUPERHOT before it, has a little more in common with an arcade lightgun shooter than it does a first-person shooter. </p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIK4D0kVlIs?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>Player-character movement remains a problem that hasn’t quite been solved, and so once again we end up with a hybrid approach that involves often staying in more or less the same spot, with a bit of ducking and diving and maybe a few short hops to either side of that fixed position. In this case, we get the point-to-teleport movement system too, which can be rather awkward but has one of the slicker implementations I’ve seen here, in that you can additional twitch a thumbstick in a given direction to specify which direction you want to be facing when you arrive. </p>, <p>It’s not quite second nature to do – every time the ‘port finishes I spin around like a Muppet, trying to work out where the enemy I was trying to get within range of has gone to – but it is fast.</p>, <p>I suppose that, in theory, the requirement for Oculus Touch controllers and their attendant second motion controller means this could seek a quasi-room scale approach, but given its levels involve streets and rooftops, making its spaces adapt to your own space might be an impossibly tall order. Anyway: my point is that this is a game in which the top half of my body is moving constantly, but my legs are those of a shy 14-year-old dancing at his first high school ball. There’s a fair whack of cognitive dissonance, but it’s a bit of a workout, in weird sort of way.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ck_NgNvT1I4?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>I should say what I’m doing, which is shooting lots and lots of robots – or ‘recalling’ them, as the sinister robot-making corporation which has tasked me with resolving a mass malfunction/rebellion puts it. I say ‘shooting’, but it is more physical than that – though in the main I’m trying to score headshots with my hands, I can also pull bullets out of mid-air and hurl them back at the bots who fired them, or grab a bot bodily then use my other hand to rip its head or a limb off. And then hurl said head or limb at the next robot. </p>, <p>Robo Recall makes me a frantic cyclone of destruction, the force of my mechanical slaughter matched only by my sheer ineptitude whenever I try to teleport. It’s a party, basically, mixing the accuracy of lightgun shooting with the physicality of Wii gaming. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rr2.jpg"/></p>, <p>Now, SUPERHOT did something similar, in terms of pairing shooting with furious arm-waving, but where that turned every encounter into a murderous logic puzzle (in what order and with what objects will you kill everyone in order to avoid being killed yourself?), this is more of a wave-based affair in which doing well enough gradually unlocks new weapon options, thus taking it closer to VR FPS norms. </p>, <p>It’s lavish with it though – robots dropping from the sky, mantling onto ledges, leaping over cars. There’s no escaping that you’re essentially playing arena-based score attack, but quite clearly a shit-ton of money and expertise has been gone into this, and it looks and feels some distance ahead of the VR shooter pack. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/rr3.jpg"/></p>, <p>I think I personally prefer Serious Sam, because of its cackling straightforwardness, but this is both better-presented and a whole lot more flexible, and as such probably sells VR better than Croteam’s simpler prospect. It doesn’t have the cool or ingenuity of SUPERHOT though, with the latter very much a VR essential in my book and this more of a ‘probably.’ It’s a good time and makes particularly excellent use of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/07/oculus-touch-games-review/">lightweight Touch controllers</a>, with their pinch’n’grab suited to gun-catching and limb-ripping in a way that the sticky-out Vive wands simply are not.</p>, <p>Of course, the thing to know there is that, at the time of writing, you get Robo Recall for ‘free’ if you buy the £100 Oculus Touch controllers, or £600 Rift+Touch bundle. If you’ve got a Rift but not the Touch, this is a strong, relatively substantial and ultra-polished freebie that’ll make the cost of entry far more palatable. Though you’ll need to go right ahead and buy SUPERHOT separately afterwards. 

A few years ago, I probably would have forgiven <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/styx-shards-of-darkness/">Styx: Shards of Darkness</a> [<a href="http://www.styx-game.com/">official site</a>] a multitude of sins (and though there is not a multitude, there is one honking great sin). A proper stealth game that isn’t low-rent or poorly balanced, with a choice of paths and abilities but which doesn’t devolve into routine action – we didn’t used to get too many of them. </p>, <p>Recent times have given us new Dishonoreds and Deus Exes and Metal Gear Solids and Hitmen, endless Assassin’s Creeds and even a so-so Thief, the game Styx most resembles. Hell, even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/13/what-can-rpgs-learn-from-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/">the new Zelda game</a> has a functional stealth element to it. We are spoilt for stealth choice, and that makes this fantasy wall-hugging sequel a tough sell. What it’s got on its side is purity. What it has against it is its lead character.<span id="more-434267"></span></p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/styx11.jpg"/></p>, <p>To get it out the way, no prior experience of the first Styx game is required to understand what’s going on here. I have not played Cyanide’s 2014 game myself, and though there is a glossing over of the setup – a fantasy world in which goblins are an animalistic pest in the world of man, but one, Styx, is intelligent – there was nothing truly unclear. The little bastard’s a thief, goddit.</p>, <p>He’s also a Thief, with Styx’s core being based heavily on the Looking Glass stealth classic – navigate around a large area, stick to the shadows, climb over and around get the loot, get out, and if you’re caught you’re almost certainly dead. However, where Thief broadly keeps its fantasy low (i.e. trick arrows and and a tricksier eyeball), Styx spins off into a few more fantastical abilities. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/styx1.jpg"/></p>, <p>The foremost of these is the heightened mobility that being a beclawed munchkin affords him, so there’s far more climbing and hanging involved here. It’s nothing you’ve not seen in, say Assassin’s Creed, but there’s a definitely a bit more hanging by your fingernails or swinging from convenient ropes than a Dishonored. </p>, <p>More singular is Styx’s ability to vomit up a mindless clone of himself, which he/you can then direct to perform a few basic actions, such as distracting an enemy or knocking something onto them from a great height. Depending on what you pump your upgrade points into, this power can expand to include summoning cloney inside a mid-air cocoon or magically swapping places with him. In terms of opening up new ways to play what’s otherwise quite a familiar game, this is your best option. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/styx2.jpg"/></p>, <p>Other tricks primarily relate to various consumables, from the obvious deadly dart to short-term invisibility potions to an acid solution that dissolves bodies on the spot. The skill tree’s big enough that one playthrough will only snag you a portion of its branches, and really that’s the biggest draw here – flexibility in how you play, but always within the boundaries of a fairly pure stealth game. </p>, <p>While Dishonored, Deus Ex, MGSV and even Hitman to a very slight extent offer the option to be a mass murderer in broad daylight, in Styx you might survive one or two fights against a lone opponent, but generally speaking getting seen means becoming a greenskin rug. Which is to say, if you object to the presence of open combat options in your stealth games, you’ll probably get a lot out of Styx. This is a game about the art of not being seen, and not really one of madcap improv if you are. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/styx3.jpg"/></p>, <p>Escape is eminently possible thanks to Styx’s mobility, and that leads to the age-old ‘must have been rats’ reset after the murderous guards’ alert timers cool off, but running and hiding is pretty much your only option. Even then, the game so loudly declares that you’ve screwed the points bonus you get for a perfect run that the temptation to reload is overwhelming. Same goes for killing – although Styx has a whole upgrade path dedicated to silent assassination, you miss out on points for mercy if you avail yourself of your weapons. </p>, <p>Now, usually I gravitate towards non-lethal options in stealth games. I like the challenge of it, be it avoidance or the generally longer incapacitation sequences involved, and I like the idea that I’m being Not A Bad Dude. The friends and family of a henchman, and all that. In Styx, however, absolutely everyone is so hateful that I simply do not give a shit. Kill ’em all. They’re all shits. It’s so much easier. Shame about those experience points, mind you.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/styx4.jpg"/></p>, <p>We’re shown a world in which most humans blindly murder goblinkind, and though Styx is the only one of them who can speak or, seemingly, think, this attitude stinks enough that I lose all my usual hesitation about bloodshed. What is mercy for here? </p>, <p>The flipside of this is that no-one in the game is more hateful than Styx himself. Perhaps some will lap up the banal venom of his humour, but for me it’s a significant misfire, to the point that I struggled to enjoy a game I otherwise would have done.</p>, <p>I suspect the game’s creators believe that, in their fourth-wall breaking, wisecracking, sneering protagonist, they’ve made Fantasy Deadpool. He chastises the player for their failings, he makes references to films and other games and pizza, he questions the likelihood that the person who bought this game will ever find a sexual partner, he insults the developers’ wisdom and talents. (Never do this in your game unless you are supremely confident your game is basically perfect, otherwise you are essentially telling the player that, yes, they’ve just wasted their money). </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/styx5.jpg"/></p>, <p>This kind of humour is playing with fire at the best of times, and Styx is very much not the best of times. The gags are incredibly broad and obvious, some of the terminology is simply insulting without being funny enough to get away with it (e.g. a woman’s weight is repeatedly mocked), many of the references are outdated and, to make matters worse, the wording often sounds like it ran through Google Translate a couple of times. </p>, <p>To his eternal credit, the guy who lends Styx his salty New Yoik tones is clearly a total pro, lending a certain amount of charisma to the character even though the actual words spoken are purely dreadful. I would buy that man a pint if I ever met him, and then clasp him into a sympathetic hug. Despite my sense that this was a good man in a bad situation, any time I died I found myself desperately hammering F9 in the hope I could quickload before the awful wisecrack-to-camera sequence that follows every death. And therein lies the rub – Styx would be an infinitely better game without Styx.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/styx6.jpg"/></p>, <p>This is a decent stealth game saddled with wretched characterisation. Insult to injury is that it has all this sub-Deadpool bollocks while at the same time offering a deeply dour fantasy story that we’re supposed to take seriously. Once in a while, Styx’s scoffing dismissal of all the magic wank is a blessed relief, but the trouble is that then the magic wank proceeds to wank on and on anyway. This is a game that’s having its wank-cake and wanking it. </p>, <p>The stealth game underneath this miserable skin is solid. Often very flashy too, in its environments, range of powers and choice of routes, but undermining that sometimes severely is that its Assassin’s Creed-style ‘jump from a ledge or wall to somewhere else’ system misfires frequently. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/styx7.jpg"/></p>, <p>Too often, I plunged to my death purely because Styx did not leap to the handhold he either either appeared to be reaching for or was the only logical place to go. It’s not quite so unreliable as to make the game consistently frustrating, but something there is seriously in need of a fix. I learned to speculatively quicksave my way around it, which isn’t ideal but was enough to let me keep thinking that this is a solid pure-breed stealth game.</p>, <p>Personally, I prefer the option for improv more than I do fealty to pure hide-or-die stealth, but it’s clear that this has put the work into making its sneaking work. Though generally saddled with a muddy aesthetic, it makes a reasonable fist of varied environments and scattering optional, harder sub-goals across them. It’ll keep you busy and, particularly if you’re playing non-lethal, demands careful planning and thought. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/styx8.jpg"/></p>, <p>There isn’t ever the magic puzzle-box feel of a Dishonored or the shocks of Thief in its bravura moments, but it mixes up its environments plenty. There’s plenty of the ‘hmm, now how can I get into there?’ of a Splinter Cell or Deus Ex. </p>, <p>Clearly, a lot of money and skill has gone into making Shards Of Darkness, which only makes the fact that you have to battle past this woeful characterisation to get to the strong stealth meat below all the more tragic. Give me a mod that lets me turn off Styx’s comments and I’ll like it a whole lot more. Until then, Styx out of ten.

Ghost Recon Wildlands</a> [<a href="https://ghost-recon.ubisoft.com/wildlands/en-GB/home/">official site</a>] is Ubisoft’s latest open-world co-op narco war. I played some of it during the beta, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/09/good-coop-bad-coop-ghost-recon-wildlands/">along with Graham</a>, and I came out of it feeling like a tub of old bath water. Lukewarm and slightly dirty. I only knew for certain that I actively disliked it when I was stricken down by one of its insta-fail stealth missions. Cast away from my carefully selected sniping spot on a sandy ridge because of a single stray bullet and dumped on the other side of the mission area, where I would have to repeat the cautious approach, the enemy spotting and the multiple silent kills all over again. It is 2017 and insta-fail stealth missions still exist. Why?<span id="more-434065"></span></p>, <p>The answer of course is: Ubisoft. A publisher who have baked the same cake dozens of times but insists that they are following a new recipe because they’ve changed the colour of the icing. In Wildlands, you are one of an elite squad of US soldiers who has come to Bolivia to save it from a pseudo-religious drug kingpin called El Sueño and his vast cartel. They’ve taken over the entire country and turned it into a narco state (I summarised this plot to a Bolivian friend, whose response was an emphatic “what the fuck?”). Anyway, you need to drive around the mountain roads and bumpy farmlands of the South American country, collecting intel that will lead to the killing or capture of buchons and underbosses. Get enough of these lower-level perps and the final mission to take on the big bossman becomes open to you.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon3.jpg"/></p>, <p>The gimmick here is that you can take on the underbosses in whatever order you want. Zoom out from the map far enough and you’re presented with a web of pictures and names, more of which get revealed with each piece of intel and each successful operation. And though it is true you can go about destablising this spider’s web by whatever silky strands you want, the next <i>jefe</i> may be in an area of much higher difficulty – tougher guards, more enemies, alarms, tanks, and so on. In reality, this web doesn’t add much to the game at all and is more for show – a method of keeping track. It isn’t reactive in any way and although power struggles between bosses occur as part of individual plotlines the characters don’t move around to fill power vacuums or fight amongst themselves in a dynamic way. Shadow of Mordor this certainly ain’t.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon2.jpg"/></p>, <p>What it <i>is</i> is something you’ll have seen before. A Far Cry in third-person set in a real country and using a realistic crisis as the springboard. Four-player co-op has been heavily marketed as the main attraction. Sneak into a cocaine factory with your friends under cover of darkness, silently take down a few guards, grab the cook, retreat to the road and put the perp in the trunk, escape without anyone even knowing you were there. And if things do go wrong, it’s suppressors off – explosion time! One friend might be setting some C4 on a ground-to-air missile battery, to make the airspace clear for another friend piloting a helicopter, while the other two hold off a wave of gunmen as they await extraction. It’s an exciting prospect and one that does occasionally come to pass. In those moments, I could see a glimmer of the game it could be. Mostly though, you’ll just be shooting heads and holding ‘E’ over supply crates.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon4.jpg"/></p>, <p>This is because it goes to supreme lengths to have you collect things, following Ubi’s icon plastered formula. You need to collect skill points to unlock new equipment or upgrade your current gadgets. You need to collect oil, technical parts, food and so on – which you also need to spend on unlocking skills. You’ll collect gun parts, new weapons and intel that unlock story missions. You’ll even collect intel that shows you were the other collectible things are. Ubi may have gotten rid of “climb the tower, reveal the map” but the spirit of the tower remains, physically invisible and yet always there. A checklist of housekeeping chores that you’ll need to perform between story missions to keep your character up to speed with the enemy. Only this time, there’s four of you sweeping the floor and the pocket money you get in return is not very motivating. An extra grenade you say? Okay, thanks! A better battery for my drone? All right, I guess so.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon5.jpg"/></p>, <p>Because of this, many of the surrounding firefights and car chases feel hollow and pointless. But the story here is also to blame. A part of me wants simply to say that it is a stupid tire fire of a storyline and talk no more about it. But the profundity of its naffness is so compelling that I am forced to stare and type into the abyss.</p>, <p>A big problem (putting aside the hackneyed bro-banter dialogue and soulless, dull characters) is the setting and the conceit. As I’ve said before, I have no issue with games tackling the problems of the real world, or occupying the countries of the real world, so long as they tackle any such problem with deftness and candour, so long as they portray any such country with depth, if not honesty. Wildlands doesn’t get half way to achieving this. When the government of Bolivia <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/06/when-does-ghost-recon-wildlands-unlock/">recently complained</a> about the country’s depiction in this latest Clancyromp, Ubisoft responded by insisting that they had recreated much of the country’s geographical and cultural splendour. And to be fair, that does sometimes feel true – you can see it in the flamingoes circling the lakes, the llamas that spit at you from the side of the road, the children in traditional dress eating ice cream and dancing in the dusty <i>calles</i>. This world is huge and a thought should be spared for all those who painstakingly mapped it. All those details along with the sheer scale of the world map created a land which often made me stop doing my checklist chores and shout to my team mates: “look at that!”</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon6.jpg"/></p>, <p>But then the creators also filled those same <i>calles</i> with hordes of narcoterrorists and their helpless victims, strung up on makeshift gallows, corpses torn into parts, burned to cinders, or left in lazy disarray after an ad hoc massacre. Ubisoft can’t fairly say that just because the landscape is true to form, with snowy peaks and stony hills, that they have created a tasteful Bolivia, full of respect and admiration for the country of reality. There are spines at the side of the road.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon7.jpg"/></p>, <p>What Ubi really want here is to have their quinceañera cake and to eat it. To fill their game with wise-looking women in traditional dress shovelling hay come rain or shine, but also to have their over-the-top ridiculous action game as well. They are welcome to try this, of course. Contrast is a great atmospheric technique and such a project definitely could be achieved with a little thoughtfulness and characterisation. But there’s none of that here. The end result is a half-game, determined to provide you with a “realistic” enemy from a contemporary crisis yet too afraid to say anything of political significance about that crisis, apart from the static US government platitude: “these narcos are some bad hombres, eh?” The lead soldierman of Wildlands, for example, is a customisable drawler called Nomad who has achieved with gusto what has long been the goal of the jingoistic shooter – to give the audience an avatar with enough tough guy blandness through whom they can freely channel all the heroism and notoriety of Chris Kyle with absolutely none of the trauma or disgrace. He is one-dimensional, if he has any dimensions at all. Thank god you can change his appearance.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon8.jpg"/></p>, <p>But this is an action game, you say, Ubi are constrained by both the genre and the large TOM CLANCY’S plastered over the top of it. And yet no such fetters stopped The Division from combining a real location with a ludicrous international emergency. It still had bland characters and rubbish voice acting and grinding collectionism but there were at least some things about the world to admire beyond the physical depiction of a rotten and frozen New York. The point is that even by the standards of ‘dumb action’ this lacks the most essential element of that genre: self-awareness.</p>, <p>I’m not really asking for manshoots to always be set in wacky fake countries, or set in real locales distorted with bizarro alternate realities. Again, a real place and a real crisis is fine. But crucially, the portrayal here is <em>not interesting</em>. It is trite, peppered with eye-rolling amounts of “we got company”, saddled with antagonists who sometimes try to be more than a single over-arching criminal Latino stereotype but in the end are always depicted as such: violent, unhinged, ultimately cowardly when faced down by a gringo with a gun.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon9.jpg"/></p>, <p>All this and I still have not mentioned how broken it is. There are bugs lurking in every corner, waiting to bite you on the ankles, like vicious bullet ants. I’m not just talking about performance issues some of which, for me, were simply the result of a graphics card too long in the tooth (I’m slumming it with a GeForce GTX 750 Ti – that’s why all my textures look like muddy water, sorry) but many of which were simply native to the game. Here’s some fun ones.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon10.jpg"/></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon11.jpg"/></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon12.jpg"/></p>, <p>This last bug could be interpreted as a rare example of the AI’s skill, since they were more often floundering in useless positions, telling me about food trucks I had already captured, or shouting loud warnings about helicopters that had blown up thirty seconds previously and which were no longer a threat. Sometimes my AI mates liked to become frozen on the spot where they would ignore all commands to regroup or change place. Sometimes they liked to commit to lines of dialogue that were bizarrely irrelevant. “The radio antenna is taking damage!” they shouted, as we snuck around an insta-fail stealth area, miles from the nearest radio antenna.</p>, <p>All this and more reveals Wildlands to be a shooter that has been released messy and unfinished, a practice that Ubi is doing with increased proficiency with each passing game, seemingly using their beta tests as demos and marketing opportunities instead of using them to actually test and repair their game to an acceptable level.</p>, <p>Despite all my complaints, the rallying cry for its defenders will always be: it’s improved with three friends. And although this is true, what lacklustre manshoot wouldn’t be improved with your mate Tom in the place of a broken AI? If a sandbox shooter demands a basic level of human closeness to make it in any way enjoyable, this raises the question: is the game itself good, or do you just like humans? I like humans and I <i>did</i> notice a huge improvement when playing with friends.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon14.jpg"/></p>, <p>Likewise, shooting drugmen alongside random folks via the in-game matchmaking made for some unexpected silliness. I was at my happiest when playing chauffeur in a helicopter to three strangers and ignoring everything else. My squadmates would mark a spot on the map where they wanted to pick up a new weapon/perform a massacre and I would fly them there, drop them off, then take off again and circle around until they needed to be picked up again. I felt like I was inhabiting a role here, the steadfast pilot that the team just can’t operate without, and it felt good that the other players silently accepted this as my role and always allowed me to fly before anyone else.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon13.jpg"/></p>, <p>In other words, I’m sure if you have the three pals and a determination to make small roles for yourselves (“Let me drive!” – “Okay, I’ll snipe from the hill” – “And I’ll be the spotter”) you’ll find that nugget of enjoyability that the game is selling itself on. The lark of pretending you’re all competent and likeable human beings. But I guarantee that before long it will become clear to you what’s really going on below the surface level of shooting Latinos in the head – you are all simply doing a checklist together in an open world with none of the madness of the Far Cry series, and certainly none of the inventiveness of MGSV, a game which already perfected the genre of open-world political interference a whole year and a half ago. Imagine if <i>that game</i> had co-op. Herein lies the fatal flaw – previous Far Crys introduced your own friends for extraneous chaos. Wildlands uses your own friends as a crutch.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/ghostlyrecon15.jpg"/></p>, <p>After years of seeing the same thing, it has become clear that Ubi games cannot function on the strength of their formula alone. And they certainly can’t rely on the strength of your mate Greg. They need some hook and less bait. At the very least they need decent story-telling or likeable characters. However, the principal problem that will forever plague this developer is that the transparency and rigidity of their formula will always hinder them. You can always see it skulking over the surface of the game, like a man in stars and stripes facepaint trying to sneak into a cocaine warehouse. It has been detected: insta-fail.

I suspect that everyone who makes games wishes they’d made Spelunky. Effectively perfect game design, unconstrained by the heavy flab of spectacle. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/loot-rascals/">Loot Rascals</a> [<a href="http://www.lootrascals.com/">official site</a>] takes that game’s random generation, escalating challenge, extreme balancing, minimal explaining and daily runs and applies it all to a slick, playful roguelite and collectable card game hybrid. Then slathers gloriously weird creature design all over it.<br/>
<span id="more-433757"></span></p>, <p>Aesthetically and tonally, it puts me a little in mind of the Katamari games – that point where what would, in the wrong hands, be mere random wackiness tilts successfully into surreal joy. Weirdo creatures, order-givers who straddle the line between chummy and malevolent and, rather than a king in tight tights, we get a laconic Scottish astronaut with a baby’s face and a space-teapot on his head. This is a delightfully-presented game, and though many of its sights and sounds are entirely arbitrary, it always stops short of annoying. Folk from the likes of Adventure Time, Hohokum and Alphabear contributed to development, and boy does that collective expertise and ingenuity show.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4CTKD43dGYo" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>Here’s the deal. You’re a spaceperson yourself, traipsing across various planetary landscapes divided into hexes and patrolled by the titular Rascals, whom you must clobber or be clobbered by. Combat is turn-based and activates whenever you share a space with an evil egg, a girl who shouts ‘bolus’, a clanky robot, a three-eyed Chewbacca or whatever wonderful oddity you’ve bumped into. </p>, <p>By and large, victory is decided by having sufficient attack power and defence power, and this is determined by the cards you have equipped. Blue ones add to your defence points, orange ones add to your offence, and any one may have bonus abilities that confer extra points to other cards, depending on where exactly you place them.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/lr2.jpg"/></p>, <p>Card placement is half the game here – the maths of working out what arrangement maxes out your stats, and making painful decisions about what cards to bench because they don’t take advantage of some other bonus. Number goes up, number goes down, wait a minute, number goes WAY up. The combinations are impeccably well-balanced, with cards often having fiendish negative effects such as -2 if it’s in on the bottom row or docking a point from every card of the same type. </p>, <p>Basically, what this means is that you’re constantly swapping stuff out, not sitting pretty with The One True Deck, and unlike a Diablolike, a new card can have a dramatic rather than subtle effect on your numbers. If there was a way to sit there with an infinite deck of cards, endlessly fiddling in pursuit of the biggest number possible, I fear I would lose a whole day to it. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/lr3.jpg"/></p>, <p>Winning a fight might randomly drop a new card, and it’s this which is the main spur to head off into dangerous territories, further and further flung from the small dome that acts as your base. Loot! But, Rascals! As far as I can tell, the Rascals are to some extent entirely randomly-generated in threat as well as type, but it does seem as though you’re more likely to run into beefier ones if your own stats are fairly high. </p>, <p>The true terror of death is that you lose all your cards if you lose a fight. You’ll resurrect (unless you’re playing the one shot and done daily challenge mode) but you’ll be puny; though the initial monsters you’ll then encounter are puny too, goddamn but you’ll miss those beautiful cards you had a minute ago. A few minutes later, of course, all you care about is the new cards in your hand now. </p>, <p>It’s one of those games where death happens fast if you don’t exercise due diligence. You only have five hitpoints (though some cards can temporarily increase this) and it’s more than possible to lose all of these in the space of one fight. Including against embarrassingly weak foes. Avoiding this means watching the numbers carefully, and keeping a close eye on Loot Rascal’s other key mechanic, which is that it flips from day to night and back again every half-dozen turns. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/lr4.jpg"/></p>, <p>Some monsters get to attack first at night, others in the day, and attacking first is what this game is really all about. If your attack’s high enough you can often take out an enemy in one hit, while facing the occasional random miniboss (also randomly-named, as in Diablo) is no longer a guaranteed death sentence. </p>, <p>I’m aware I’ve spent most of this piece describing mechanics rather than offering opinions as such, and this is because that’s what Loot Rascals is underneath its gonzo, capering skin – a game of mechanics. Easy to learn, difficult to master mechanics, which you can never take your eye off. That it feels entirely like its own true-blue videogame and not like an adaptation of a CCG is testament to how cleanly all its many moving parts slots together. This is such a slick wee thing. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/lr5.jpg"/></p>, <p>There’s another neat feature somehow squeezed into this Jenga tower of ingenuity, whereby baddies rob a card from you if they beat you, and other players may then find that card by defeating bosses in their own games. And you, of course, might find their lost treasures, at which point you can decide whether to send it back to them or keep it. This has only happened to me a couple of times – I think the playerbase needs time to build up – but apparently this can result in rewards or payback, which I have not yet experienced. Probably because I die too quick. A lovely idea and one that, I suspect, will make more difference the more you invest in this. </p>, <p>Even so, I did feel as though I’d seen all the game was fairly early on – that it would be a matter of finessing my skills far more than it would be a voyage of discovery. While that’s true of Spelunky too, it did hook new players on the mystery of what might lie ahead, the increasing weirdness and menace of later areas, before, for some of us, becoming a ritual test of skill. See also The Binding Of Isaac, which this also has a few commonalities with. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/16/may/loot-rascals.jpg"/></p>, <p>There’s a loose, comic story about rebuilding a big robot wrapped around the thing, but really it immediately becomes about endlessly bettering yourself. Leaderboards and daily challenges and all that jazz – long-term investment. Catnip for many people, but I don’t know that it got its hooks in deep enough to trigger that impulse in me. </p>, <p>Though Loot Rascals has been deeply charming for a couple of days, I can’t see myself returning to it over and over in that way. That said, the daily challenges do save it from an otherwise open-ended feel – each new area reached or mega-card found feels that much more momentous when death is absolute, rather than an inconvenience. </p>, <p>Funny, strange, sweet, accessible, as intricate as a Gordian knot with it. Loot Rascals is a smart piece of game design executed with delightful style. Even so, it feels as though the mechanics overwhelm all else – I do think it would benefit from offering more structure and goals in order to then earn the daily-play status it clearly desires.

Every Monday we order Brendan to examine the early access entrails for signs of coming chaos. This week, the guts tell of a magical and old-fashioned RPG called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/for-the-king/">For The King</a> [<a href="http://www.ironoakgames.com/">official site</a>] with strange rougelike properties…<br/>
</i></p>, <p>Death comes easily to the intrepid hex explorer. If you’re lucky, you’ll just get a quick bandit axe in the forehead. But if you’re like me, only the most scurrilous death will do. In a poison bog surrounded by old swamp hags, for example. Or deep underground at the hands of deranged cultists and their bat minions. These are just some of the ways you can (will) die in For The King, a shiny and modern-looking RPG that nevertheless retains a good and ancient heart. And by that I mean it has absolutely no qualms about murdering you.<br/>
<span id="more-433425"></span></p>, <p>It’s old-fashioned for a number of reasons. The battles are turn-based 3v3 jab-fests and it’s all centered on travels across a hex-based map. You pick three party members at the start, whose classes you can choose and appearance you can stylise to a very limited degree. The blacksmith has a smashy hammer and can stun enemies, for instance. The hunter has a bow and a bonus against flying perps like bats, as well as being better at sneaking on the world map (more on this later).</p>, <p>I began my first and ill-fated misadventure with one of these hunters, to whom I granted a white beard and the name Old Lars. He was accompanied by a Minstrel called Sally McWrecker, who damaged her enemies by playing pleasant music at them, and a Scholar named Mr Paulson, who attacked things by reading from a book I can only presume was so boring it physically hurt anyone who listened.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/fortheking_2.jpg"/></p>, <p>There’s a mandatory plotline involving the King’s recent assassination and the Queen’s attempts to discover the truth. Off you go to wherever she sends you along this questline, where you discover that the game is really a race against a force called Chaos. This increases with every passing day, adding skulls to a little Chaos meter above the map. They also seemed to pop up when party members died, though it’s hard to say if that was the cause or just coincidence. The exact pattern and reasons for the advance of human headbones isn’t very well explained. Nevertheless, the skulls can be set back by completing the Queen’s questlines, making it feel like an XCOM-style race against encroaching bad things. Higher levels of Chaos cause weird things to come and hinder your progress. After a few skulls were added to the map a “hangman” began to haunt my heroes, who became assaulted by surprise ghosts wherever they walked.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/fortheking_3.jpg"/></p>, <p>To complicate things, there is also a day and night cycle, with more dangerous and numerous enemies popping up when the sun goes down. You move around the map turn by turn, each party member moving independently. If one of your little reprobates gets into a disagreement with a giant bee or dancing imp, the others will only join if they are in range of the fight – generally speaking, this means within two or three hexes. But the same applies to nearby foes. They’ll come to the bee’s aid if they live within the blood-red range of hexes of their own pal. As far as I experienced it though, you can’t fight more than three baddies at a time. You’ll know which enemies are coming to help your arch-nemesis, the bee, by their appearance on the map – blacked out and inactive means they aren’t coming to the fight. Highlighted and coloured means they are coming to bust your head.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/fortheking_4.jpg"/></p>, <p>But when the daytime rolls around, the skeletons and ghosts and witches evaporate (mostly) and you get more room to manoeuvre. It’s possible to sneak by enemies completely, or “ambush” them, which means their pals won’t come calling even if they are in range. But this relies on the roll of unseen dice. These dice are more or less the gooey centre of the entire game. Choices and percentages litter both the world map and the battle screen. Your chance to hit anything is determined by luck, which can be stacked in your favour in various ways (equipment, stat boosts, herbs, hats) and your chance to sneak past a beastman or ambush an ogre is likewise affected by this.</p>, <p>However, to keep your characters from being too far out of your own control, there’s a “focus” system. You can right click on any choice or attack to add a point of focus and increase the chance of succeeding. Each character has their own pool of these focus points and you can recharge them by sleeping in inns, setting up a camp, eating special herbs, or levelling up at a super-convenient time. There’s still a sense of risk and reward here, because although adding focus to an attempt to shoot a cultist with an arrow will increase the chance of landing a good and strong hit, it doesn’t guarantee anything unless you sink all your focus points into that task – a decision best kept for when success is <em>absolutely necessary</em>.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/fortheking_5.jpg"/></p>, <p>The whole game hinges on this mechanic and quickly becomes a quest about using your focus points wisely, saving them for a critical moment or making it rain like a rich gangster when you know there’s a town just a few hexes away for replenishment. Then, of course, you reach the town and discover that you don’t have enough money to let everyone sleep in the inn.</p>, <p>This is the other side of the RPG coming into play. There are a lot of places to visit – caves to explore, camps to raid, catacombs to graverob, towns to go shopping in – and a lot of enemies to fight. But there is precious little time and precious little money. You are often scraping the bottom of your purse to afford one good thing – a new staff for your scholar, a single suit of armour for your blacksmith, a teleport scroll so that your hunter can catch up with the others on the map before night falls and he gets cut off by a gang of mardy skeletons. I’m always pleased when a game has the courage to put you in a rich world as a poor person. Decisions on what to buy or where to go feel important and lasting because of this. Buying a ship might get you to the next quest location in record time, but it’s so expensive it will leave you all stoney broke for the next day or two.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/fortheking_6.jpg"/></p>, <p>As for the time constraints, I’ll give you an example. In my first game, I took on an extra quest in our hometown. All we needed to do, it said, was deliver a leather pouch with some unknown contents to a nearby town in the outskirts of the local swamp. Easy. But no road is empty in For The King. Or rather, there are no roads. Just a wilderness full of irksome bats and huge stone hulks. We finally did reach the town but because of the time it had taken us night had already fallen, which made all the backtracking to take on our original (more important) quest all the more difficult. By the time we reached the first chaos generator in the final dungeon of the first quest, we were at 3 out of 5 Chaos kulls, which was, I felt, cutting it pretty close.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/fortheking_7.jpg"/></p>, <p>That sense of scrounging and under-epuipped-ness is pleasing to any thoroughbred adventurer/hapless victim. Here, things are made even more difficult by the party system, or the lack thereof. You move each hero individually, they all have their own purse of money and their own inventory bags. Only when they’re near each other can they swap gold or items. The game also randomises (to a degree) how much each hero can travel during their turn, some able to move farther than others, leading to surprise fights in which your people are split up and have to fend for themselves.</p>, <p>Even the battle mechanics prioritise individual actions over the actions of a sensible party. One day on our adventures, Sally McWrecker and Mr Paulson found themselves facing down some bats without the help of their archer pal, because he was lagging behind a few hexes. This normally wouldn’t be a problem, except the bats had a huge golem friend who came to join the fight. He had 38 health and his punches could deal huge damage to my scruffy pair of low-level vagabonds. Seeing that the fight was not going in our favour, I clicked on the “flee” option during Sally’s turn, which if successful would send us one hex back and end the turn but leave us in safety. At least, that is what I gleaned from the hovering tooltip.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/fortheking_8.jpg"/></p>, <p>What really happened was this: Sally McWrecker rolled a successful “flee” action and slunk away from the fight with a pathetic wave, leaving Mr Paulson, by far the weakest and most vulnerable of the trio, totally alone, whereupon he was succinctly punched to death by a living rock.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/fortheking_9.jpg"/></p>, <p>Luckily, you can revive a character just by visiting the hex their corpse is on (the enemies take a walk after a lost fight) and picking them up. Whereas a true ‘game over’ will come down upon your heads if your entire party dies in the battle screen. In the open map this is less likely, but in the trap-filled, multi-fight, mulit-layered dungeons it is much more likely, since you don’t get the reward or complete the relevant quest unless you buck up and see it through to the end.</p>, <p>Here you have to fight wave after wave of enemies, but each one offers good loot and often drops herbs that can be used to heal or regain lost focus points between the dungeon’s rooms. But these dungeons are still not easy, as Old Lars will tell you after he got entangled by a cursed witch and was forced to watch his friends die before he too was helplessly stabbed to pieces by an unfettered bone warrior.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/fortheking_10.jpg"/></p>, <p>In short, it isn’t a pleasant walk through Pallet town. The limitations on your party – the scrubby equipment they find or can afford, their walking speed, their lack of healing items or gold coin – all serve to make it a solid romp full of those tiny decisions and random occurrences that can alter the course of your game for better or worse.</p>, <p>There is one big problem I feel, in that the main quest is the same at every restart. The map is newly generated each time, yes, but the quest from the Queen always stays the same. After a while I just wanted to explore the world at my own pace for once. There are many towns you won’t even think of visiting, because they aren’t on the Queen’s pre-ordained list of stopovers, or even placed along the way.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/fortheking_11.jpg"/></p>, <p>This main quest itself is also blurby fantasy pish, without an ounce of humour or character. This is something that surprised me, considering the visual style of the game is so cute and cartoony, perfectly suited to a sillier story and characters who don’t take their existence as undead skeleton warriors too seriously. Unfortunately, the humour and cheer has to be found between your own rash or botched decisions and the bad luck of your three poverty-stricken losers, or in the daft over-the-top ragdoll deaths of your victims. That humour is there, certainly. The sight of Sally skulking away like a coward during that one fight was enough to make me laugh anyway. But I still feel like the creators are missing an easy window to keep things short-winded and free of dull fantasy mumbo-jumbo. One of the first things you see after starting a new game is a wall of lore-filled text about the Kingdom and the Queen and the Chaos and <em>YAWN YAWN YAWN</em>.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/fortheking_12.jpg"/></p>, <p>Putting those concerns aside, however, For The King retains a good sense of pacing and toughness. Even the easy mode can slip you up and bash you on the noggin with a gang of wretched sea hags for which you are sorely under-prepared. It feels at times like an old-fashioned turn-based party JRPG that has learned to fight like a roguelike, embracing randomness and strange loot. During one dungeon crawl, Sally McWrecker was only equipped with a shield. One of her options in the fight was to pull out a random weapon from her backpack. She did this and whipped out a glass sword I had received from doing that time-consuming delivery job. I’d forgotten about this weapon. It cut massive chunks of health off the enemies. I was very happy. If I had only read the item’s description more thoroughly, I would not have been so surprised when the sword shattered to pieces after one final blow against an unworthy skeleton, who himself shattered to pieces, probably laughing. Sally was again reduced to punching her enemies in the belly with her bare hands.</p>, <p>It’s silly moments like that which harbour the magic of For The King. As ever, early access means things may change, and I certainly hope that there comes some mode in which the Queen’s orders and main quests can be thoroughly ignored. But for now, if you’re seeking some badly-planned misadventure, and a scurrilous death, you could do a lot worse.

A few days before Christmas, I was involved in a car accident. No-one was seriously hurt, but I spent 90 minutes stood alone on a central reservation, shaking from both cold and shock, watching car after car after car nearly collide with my own wrecked and dangerously stranded vehicle, waiting for police who never came. I called twice. Both times I was told they’d be right there. They did not show (FYI roadside recovery did eventually, an hour after their ETA). I was as furious as I was terrified.</p>, <p>15 minutes with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/911-operator/">911 Operator</a> [<a href="http://jutsugames.com/911/">official site</a>] was all it took to entirely sympathise with why they didn’t send a car out. <span id="more-433111"></span></p>, <p>The rule here is “if nobody’s dying, there’s no hurry”. Squad cars, ambulances and fire engines – the holy rescue trinity in this emergency services strategy game – are forever at a premium. Dispatch one to help resolve a situation that is, at the time of a call, bloodless and there’s every chance you’ll find you can’t send anyone to help an even more serious situation. Or it’s simply that all your cars are on other, non-lethal calls, so whichever unforunate just dialled up simply has to wait. </p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UZieE4LT6JI?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>Maybe all the police in Dartford were in a stand-off with armed criminals when I called. Maybe there was a particularly high number of disputes about trees growing into neighbour’s yards. Maybe my story just didn’t meet the operators’ criteria for calamity. I mean, no-one did get hurt in the end. They made their judgement calls. Perhaps they were right. </p>, <p>But they could have been wrong, as I have been several times in 911 Operator. I told someone who asked for a pizza to stop wasting my time, failing to twig that they were pretending to the other, violent person in the room with them that this was the purpose of their call. They ended up in hospital. The next day, I was slightly more inquisitive about but ultimately again dismissive of a woman’s complaint about how loud her neighbour’s TV was, and only later did I find out it was because the man had died in his own living room. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/9112.jpg"/></p>, <p>Judgement calls. 911 Operator is all about judgement calls. It’s a quiet revelation about scenarios I imagine most of us have suspected but never fully thought about. The other revelation is that initial panic and guilt about these kinds of situations soon gives way to cold utilitarianism. My thoughts shifted away from “I have to help this person” or “what if there’s more to this than meets the eye?” and into “well, nothing is obviously wrong, so I just can’t justify the units,” and increasingly I felt no remorse if an initially shrug-worthy situation had awful consequences. </p>, <p>If I’d have sent someone out there speculatively, I wouldn’t have been able to stop the sexual assault on the other side of town. I wouldn’t have been able to put out that fire in a parking garage. </p>, <p>911 Operator succeeds more as thought experiment about this constant dilemma for emergency service workers than it does a game. As a game, it’s the same looped five minute experience, with varying degrees of pressure to it. You sit in front of a map of the city you’re playing in, choosing which emergencies to assign which vehicles to, interspersed with phone calls in which you need to elicit appropriate information – severity, location, possible escalations, if it’s a total idiot – in order to make your judgement call. </p>, <p>Some situations require multiple vehicles, some situations escalate even after you’ve arrived – your police need backup because someone starts shooting, or someone’s injured because you couldn’t get to them in less than a heartbeat – and some situations have to be abandoned because something more terrible has occurred elsewhere. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/9113.jpg"/></p>, <p>Mostly, though, you’re just right-clicking to send a police car, ambulance or fire engine to a point on the map, and hoping nothing else goes wrong while you wait for them to get there. It’s compelling in small doses, but only a few hours in I’d taken its point to heart and struggled to see what else I might take from it. It’s definitely effective at creating tension, which I admire, but that tension grows increasingly one-note.</p>, <p>There’s a meta-game that entails efficient, well-judged decisions gradually earning enough money to purchase more and better vehicles and ancillary equipment. Perhaps there’s commentary here about ruthless government/state restrictions on police budgets, but in a game context it came across like artificial gating. This’d be easy if I had a fleet of helicopters, but to get that I have to grind. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/9114.jpg"/></p>, <p>The other big selling point here is that, as well as playing in a campaign mode that darts between various US cities, you can freeplay in any city from anywhere in the world, and a fair few small towns too. Unfortunately you’re stuck with US voices, equipment and terminology wherever you plump for – and indeed crimes. I can assure you that the only shootings in Pershore, Worcestershire involve poor wildfowl. </p>, <p>Localisation seems like the most obvious and necessary addition 911 needs to add in, if its current Steam sales hot streak lasts long enough. The other is that, though it’s briefly pleasing to see the more or less recognisable monochrome outline of my home city, you can’t zoom in to see street names or photographic imagery, so it might as well be anywhere. </p>, <p>The ‘what about… [pissant small town you grew up in]’ is a one-off delight that lasts only moments, but I can definitely see how this thing could evolve. That said, some of the crimes it features are horrific, and as such becoming too playful might become deeply inappropriate.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/9115.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s a couple of evening’s worth of exploring a concept and buying a few upgrades for under a tenner. I don’t <em>not</em> recommend it on that basis – the single greatest thing about PC gaming is that it’s a medium which will explore every niche, and I was glad for a brief nose at this one. It is a bit crashy in its current form through, and that paired with the feeling that it needs a little more meat on its bones makes me more inclined to suggest waiting a month or two.

For a while there, back in 2014, we were rather excited to see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/four-sided-fantasy/">Four Sided Fantasy</a> [<a href="http://foursidedfantasy.com/">official site</a>]. Then things went quiet. And then, er, the game came out last August. Oops. So why now? Well, I was looking up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/25/four-last-things-comedy-adventure-game/">Four Last Things</a>, the bonkers (and a bit annoying, honestly) Renaissance painting adventure, and clicked the wrong button. Yeah. Welcome to RPS.</p>, <p>Crikey, Four Sided Fantasy is rather good. It’s not too late to tell you.<span id="more-432721"></span></p>, <p>OK, look, I’ll be even more honest. I’m more motivated to post about this right now because of the twitching horror inside me at typing out the game’s name without the bloody hyphen it should have. Four-Sided. FOUR-SIDED. Oh my goodness.</p>, <p>That aside, and <em>believe me</em> I’m going to be writing it correctly from now on, this is a really smart reality-warping puzzle platformer that merits our attention.</p>, <p>Although that attention is best kept if you ignore its puke-inducing bullshit conceit. For some godforsaken reason this is about trying to reunite a boy and a girl who are trying “to find each other”, but separated by an inability to share the same portion of reality. Oh, if only these two blank-faced anonymous cartoons could be together, I could sleep at night again! All that matters now is their love, because the game’s description said it was so! Bleaurgh. Honestly, it’d have been so much better if this featured a cartoon bear and chicken alternating in the space. I care about bears and chickens getting to hang out.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/four01.jpg"/></p>, <p>The premise (yes, we got there!) is this: Your character runs about in the standard side-scrolling platform way, fixed to the centre of the screen as the world moves around them. But at any point you can freeze the screen, and move the character around it. And if that freezed screen has open exits both left and right, or up and down, you can go off one side of the screen and come back on the other.</p>, <p>This leads to an immediate wealth of lovely puzzles. At their most basic, say you’re running along the open ground and then a giant pillar of rock blocks your path, freeze the screen, run to the far left, and appear on the far right the other side of the pillar. Of course, this is by far not the first game to use that mechanic, but it’s the first I can think of (yes, yes, the Spanish-only Mega CD game you know about did it too) where its your freezing the action that creates the borders. And this leads to much more elaborate challenges, where you’re leaping toward an abyss, but up enough that the dangerous area goes off the bottom of the screen, and instead you fall down through to the top of the screen where you can angle right to land on a moving platform. Maybe line the screen up just right so walking left and right has you fall down through gaps in what would otherwise be impassable floors of rock below you. Or even something as simple (but unintuitive) as freezing the screen above a long stretch of deadly static, but with rock blocking the top, and then just walking along the bottom of the screen!</p>, <p>The further you get, the more it asks you to think, and the more complicated the moves become as you bend time and space to your will. And at no point does it become meaningful or relevant that every time you pass a boundary and reappear, you change from boy to girl to boy to girl again. Honestly, it would have been fine if you were just one character the whole time. It’s silly. Stop it.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/four04.jpg"/></p>, <p>The art is pretty lovely, simple but effective, and I really like the design of the two characters. The game’s big imperfection, however, comes with the jumping. It’s not significantly bad, but it feels just slightly off, just not <em>quite</em> right as you drift. I think it’s something to do with the analogue controller sticks, the game over-sensitive and trying to walk instead of run at key moments. Playing both Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight this week too has made the issue more apparent, emphasising the difference between when it feels right, and when it feels wrong. Those two games handle the motion of jumping very differently, but each feels just right for its context. This one, it feels like you’re not quite getting the movement you ought. Not a game-breaker by a long stretch, but a little grumbly.</p>, <p>The other really odd aspect is the scenery changing. Early on you run down long corridors of rock or grass to get to newer areas, but then after a while there’s a point where as you run right, the screen goes black for a bit, and then PING, you’re somewhere else with no explanation or transition. It feels incredibly half-finished in these moments, and it’s hard to believe it was ever the intention to have the game just suddenly and jarringly stop, then carry on in a different location like nothing happened.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/four02.jpg"/></p>, <p>But then it adds new surprises. Imagine a typical platforming scenario, a long narrow corridor with a blast of something-me-do hurtling down every few seconds. You’ve got to make your progress in the gaps, right? But what happens if you freeze the screen and those blasts keep on coming in? You end up with those going out of the left side of the screen coming back in the right, along with new ones, until you’re bombarded with the things. Not helpful, but what if you could figure out a way to have them pile up somewhere else by these means? Or what about when each of the two characters are affected by gravity differently, so going out of the screen and on again flips the direction in which you fall?</p>, <p>It all works really rather well, and is accompanied by a very pleasing ambient soundtrack, along with nature noises chirping and squawking over the Eno-esque keyboardy tones. And it gets rewardingly difficult, without feeling unfair, or relying on ninja reflexes. (Clearly I have them, but they’re left in their box here.)</p>, <p>This is well worth a look, and a good scratch of the head.

Consider this a slight tangent from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/20/alienware-15-2017-review/">my ongoing quest</a> to decide which gaming laptop to buy by reviewing a bunch of them. The <a href="https://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-blade-stealth">Razer Blade Stealth</a> is not a gaming laptop, despite coming from a company most known for aggressively ‘gamer’-orientated technology. It’s an ultrabook, which is to say very thin and light, which means no discrete graphics card and a low-power processor. The Macbook Air would be the most obvious point of comparison. </p>, <p>The situation changes when it’s hooked up to a speaker-sized black metal box known officially as <a href="https://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-core">the Razer Core</a>. This is an external graphics card enclosure, which, with a single cable connected to a port on its outside edge, enables the Stealth to run a desktop GPU. Too good to be true? As it happens, no.<span id="more-432441"></span></p>, <p><strong>Note – the bulk of this piece covers the Razer Core eGPU, so in order to give the Stealth laptop a fair shake without this piece becoming too unwieldy, that gets its own review, specs breakdown and whatnot on page 2 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=432441&amp;page=2">here</a>. </strong></p>, <p>Barring some miracle in miniaturisation, desktop PCs are always going to have an edge over portables when it comes to performance, and even more of an advantage when it comes to upgradeability. However, the Core – and with it the wider concept of eGPUs, of which there are other models available – has me convinced that, at some point within the next few years, we’re going to see a significant shift in the gaming PC model. </p>, <p>I don’t want two PCs, one for home and one for the road. It might be luxurious but it’s not terribly practical. I want one PC, with all my stuff on it, that I can use anywhere. I want a laptop that I dock into something that adds a full-fat graphics card, a big external monitor, keyboard and maybe an extra hard drive or two. </p>, <p>The Stealth+Core combo doesn’t quite realise that dream, for reasons I’ll get into shortly, but it comes damned close. Close enough that I believe this dream will become real surprisingly soon.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/tb3.jpg"/><em>A Thunderbolt 3 port, yesterday.</em></p>, <p>The key to this is the multi-purpose port known as Thunderbolt 3. Think of it as a super-fast successor to USB, able to transfer vast amounts of data incredibly quickly, and, in the case of the Stealth, even enough power to recharge the battery at the same time. This one port to rule them all model has lately been popularised by Apple, but we’re only going to see more of it on PC laptops too.</p>, <p>Sure, crazy-fast external hard drive transfer speeds are nice to have, but my key interest in Thunderbolt 3 is that its bandwidth is sufficient to hook up a high-end desktop graphics card. Now, this whole tech – and the Core is only one of a growing number of eGPU boxes – is still shaking out, and I’ve struggled to find definitive answers on just where the ceiling lies. </p>, <p>What can cope with today’s graphics cards may find that the bandwidth demands of, say, a 2019 GPU are just too great. Cables and plugs also introduce potential latency issues that aren’t in play for the more direct PCB connection of a PCI-Express slot. But, yes, in theory right now you could drop, say, a GTX 1080 into an eGPU and be getting at least similar results to what you’d get if the card was inside a desktop PC.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/core1.jpg"/></p>, <p>Sadly, I didn’t have a 1080 to hand for testing – the best I had was a Radeon RX 480, a £200ish that, at the time of writing, is pretty much the best bang-for-buck going in terms of playing games at 1080p and high settings. Pertinently, it is also sufficient to get the Witcher 3 running at 4K and 30 frames per second on the Razer Stealth’s spectacularly vibrant 12.5″ touchscreen (a cheaper, non-touch 1440p model is also available). </p>, <p>This is a surreal sight. The Stealth is a tiny, thin, beautiful thing – the very opposite of what we would traditionally consider to be a gaming laptop. Seeing a game looking as good as any current game could possibly look on a machine like this is <em>bonkers</em>. Well, at least until you stop pretending that the plus-size, loudly-whirring obsidian shoebox just to one side of it isn’t there. </p>, <p>The Core is a big bunny, there’s no getting around it. While you might expect something not much bigger than a graphics card, the reality is that it has to contain a dedicated power supply too, and allow sufficient space that the card doesn’t overheat. The entirely ignorant armchair designer in me does feel that the Core could surely be 10 or 20% without smaller and that perhaps its one-big-heatsink style is more about showing off than mere practicality, but I could well be wrong there. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/core2.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s not a <em>monster</em>, and certainly a heckuva lot smaller than having a desktop PC. Push all thoughts of stowing it under your desk and out of sight out of your mind though, as the Thunderbolt 3 is necessarily half a metre short – much longer than that and its bandwidth would halve from 40Gbps to 20Gbps, with potentially enormous framerate consequences. Tech for cables that maintain full speed at greater distances is in development, but right now you’re saddled with having to sit the Core effectively right next to the laptop. Not a great look for your desk, and means you’re sat right next to the GPU and its invariably noisy fan too. </p>, <p>Sweetening the pill a little is that, all via the one Thunderbolt 3 connection to the Stealth, the Core has four USB 3 ports and an ethernet socket on its rear, so it really can work like a dock to transform laptop &gt; desktop. It even passes through power to the Stealth, so you don’t need a second cable coming out of the laptop. With the Core connected to my big monitor too, this was a little bit of Nintendo Switch at PC home – one plug was all it took to flick between ‘modes.’ </p>, <p>The software side of things is surprisingly straightforward. Essentially, on first connect you tell the laptop what it wants to do whenever it’s connected to the Core, and everything happens automatically from thereon in – including adapting to whether you have an external monitor connected or not.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/core4.jpg"/></p>, <p>Speaking of which, expect diminished performance if you’re using the Core to play games on the laptop’s own screen instead of a secondary one. This is because image data has to be pushed back to the machine along the Thunderbolt connection at effectively the same time as the laptop feeding instructions to the graphics card. Two cars driving in opposite directions along the same narrow road. </p>, <p>In practice, the consequences of this will differ depending on the demands of the game, but in my testing with the Witcher 3, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and Resident Evil 7, I was generally seeing a handicap of about 10 frames per seconds. In most cases I could ameliorate this sufficiently by dropping a few settings – as I say, I managed to get Witcher 3 running at 4K on the laptop’s own screen at 30 FPS with decent settings – but as games grow more demanding and graphics cards more powerful, this may become more of an issue. My point being that the Core, and other enclosures like it, may not be the “I don’t need to upgrade my laptop for years” solution it sometimes promises to be.</p>, <p>Especially on an external monitor, though, I was deeply impressed by how well games ran. The 480 is some distance south of a top-end GPU, but in most cases it’s up to 1080p, high settings and 60 frames, and that was borne out via the Core. What I did find, however, is that the Stealth/Core 480 combo did not run quite as well at my monitor’s native 3440×1440 as did the 480 when fitted inside my desktop PC. This varied from 5 to 20 frames per second depending on game and depending on scene within that game. Not disastrous at all in some cases, but the difference between 60fps and 30fps (if you do Vsync) in others. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/core5.jpg"/></p>, <p>This may be down to some Thunderbolt 3 ceiling being hit (I’ve tried and failed to find definitive answers about its eGPU limitations, but look forwards to being put in my place in comments), or it may be because the Stealth has a dual-core, low power CPU in an age when games often benefit from quad core. It’s a seventh generation Intel Core chip (aka Kaby Lake) but it’s by no means the equal of the 7700HQ we saw in the Alienware 15 review last week. </p>, <p>To assess this I was also loaned a Razer Blade, a bigger, heavier 14” machine which I’ll write about in its own review another time, and which contained a faster, quad-core chip. The drop-off lessened and performance was more in line with what I saw on my desktop (which is to say not to expect 60fps at 3440×1440 on this card without dropping quite a few settings), but the difference wasn’t as stark as expected. I say that positively rather than negatively, as more than anything I’m surprised by how well the Stealth’s weeny CPU coped. 4K Witcher 3 and DXMD (albeit 30 fps, which can primarily be blamed on the GPU anyway)! </p>, <p>I’m sure there will be more CPU-limited games for which this is much more problematic, but given the relatively minor effects on my trio of recent mainstream titles, it’s food for thought about how much a CPU upgrade can meaningfully benefit games right now. </p>, <p>I suspect a quad-core Stealth coupled with a Core containing, say, a GTX 1070 would be something of a dream machine. The thin’n’light go-anywhere laptop that transforms into a home gaming machine only a few steps behind what a dedicated desktop could achieve.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/core6.jpg"/><em>Lego Batgirl for scale</em></p>, <p>The Stealth+Core is but one way to achieve that right now, too. Any laptop with a Thunderbolt 3 port can in theory talk to an eGPU, including the Core, although word is that can sometimes involve a bit of fiddling on anything other than a Razer system. If you’re in the market for a new latop and like to play games, do not even consider buying one without a Thunderbolt 3 port, as you might be cutting yourself off from significant upgrade possibilities later. Even then, you need to be careful and do your research, as some, for example Dell’s latest XPS and Inspiron 15, are nerfed to only run at half-speed.</p>, <p>If you go the tried’n’tested Razer route, money is a huge issue, however – £500 for the Core dock alone, then you’ve got to provide a graphics card and a Thunderbolt 3-equipped laptop. You’re probably not looking at much change from £2000 if you do the whole thing from scratch. Of course, a laptop without an internal discrete GPU is far cheaper than one with, and hopefully we’ll soon see more proliferation of TB3 in cheaper portables. </p>, <p>And if game performance continues to be only mildly affected by CPU capability, as has been the case for many years now, we might be looking at a situation whereby buying a laptop now lasts you for much longer than has historically been the case. You pay through the nose now, but ‘only’ need to buy a new GPU every couple of years instead of redoing the whole kit and kaboodle. (Until Thunderbolt 4 comes along and ruins everything, no doubt). </p>, <p>This future is coming. It won’t be long. It’s not <em>quite</em> here now, but if you’ve got the money to spend you can achieve surprisingly great things that are surprisingly uncomplicated to setup and use.

Hollow Knight</a> [<a href="http://hollowknight.com/">official site</a>] presents a peculiar issue. What do you do with a game that is genuinely good, but rather unoriginal? A game that is so, <em>so</em> similar to others that have come recently before it, but is still a beautifully drawn, solidly built metroidvania? Do you say, “Get this one, because it’s the most recent?” That’s not a coherent argument. Unfortunately for Hollow Knight, I think the design decisions that narrowly define it are really its core weaknesses.<span id="more-432615"></span></p>, <p>I love these sorts of games. I can wile away many hours jumping around their labyrinthine caves, eeking out new abilities to reach new areas, incrementally improving my health, jump, attacks and skills so that what was once a challenge becomes a corridor on the way to the new challenge. It’s a wonderful model, and it’s been done wonderfully many times before. So Hollow’s choices to make what are stalwarts of the genre into its most frustrating features is a disappointing decision. I have played for a good few hours, but am only a fraction of the way into the game. Keep that in mind as you read.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/hol01.jpg"/></p>, <p>We’re not short of competition. This year has already offered us the utterly splendid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/08/alwas-awakening-review/">Alwa’s Awakening</a>, then just a few months back we had the triumphant release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/11/01/owlboy-review/">Owlboy</a>. 2016 also saw the competent (but extraordinarily familiar) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/07/14/song-of-the-deep-review/">Song Of The Deep</a>, and the sublime <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/03/ori-and-the-blind-forest-definitive-edition-review/">Ori &amp; The Blind Forest’s definitive edition</a>. Then there’s Aquaria, Axiom Verge, Environmental Station Alpha, The Swapper, VVVVVV, Cave Story+, Guacamelee, and the dozen others you’re annoyed I’ve not listed. And of that list, most problematic for Hollow Knight is Ori &amp; The Blind Forest.</p>, <p>The two games have a great deal in common, but Ori is just better in every element. And sure, that’s an awkward critical path (“this game isn’t as good as the best example of this genre”), but it starts to become a more imposing issue when the game in question appears to bring nothing new to the table.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/hol04.jpg"/></p>, <p>In Hollow Knight, you play a bug-like creature exploring (wait for this) a formerly rich and vibrant underground world that is now grey and ruined. Goodness me, how did they think of this?! At the start you’re limited to a melee attack and a basic jump, and as you progress through its caves you gain new skills and buy others from a growing number of above-ground merchants. Out of reach areas become in reach when you gain, say, a dash move, which leads you to new zones and their fresh crop of currently impassable obstacles. It is, to put it more briefly, a stock metroidvania.</p>, <p>From this foundation most games listed a couple of paragraphs above bring their own new details. Owlboy has your character able to carry another in his talons, bringing in their unique abilities as you fly through its world. The Swapper has its key mechanic to make it stand out. Ori has a tale of deep emotion, breathtaking art and… well, here’s the rub. Ori is actually not especially original – it just messed things up for those that come after it by taking the core foundations and delivering them with something close to perfection. So when Hollow Knight steps onto the battlefield with no unique weapon of its own, Ori just squishes it.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/hol02.jpg"/></p>, <p>I began by alluding to its weaknesses and perhaps now I name them you’ll take umbrage. Hollow Knight takes core features of the genre and then tries to tell you they’re special. Like, perhaps at its most egregious, your position on a map. Maps are tricky enough here, with new zones not possible to even map as you explore them – you have to buy or find a pre-created map to even bring up the map screen for an area, and then fill in the dotted lines of where you’ve yet to explore. Quite why your character can’t know that they just walked down a path and went left I’m not sure, but that’s how it is. You can spend long stretches aimlessly stumbling around until you find your way out. But on top of this, to see where your character is on a map when you have one is considered a feature, a special ability gained by purchasing it from a shop and then using one of your precious ability slots to implement it. A basic standard of the genre, locked up behind a purchase and a skill use. So, so weird.</p>, <p>So rather than enjoying a burgeoning pool of abilities, you’re restricted to however many ability slots you have, and choosing between them. I’d <em>love</em> to use the skill I paid a small fortune for that makes drops magnetically attracted toward me, but I really can’t live without the extra soul gathering from attacked enemies (used for both healing and crucial ranged attacks), and knowing where the hell I am on the near-identical monochrome section of a level at any point. Any other game in the genre lets me have all three without a fuss, and doesn’t even consider one of them a special feature.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/hol05.jpg"/></p>, <p>My other big issue here is again something that might have you cry, “At last! What I’ve always wanted!”, and all power to you. The game feels way too loose and sprawling to me. With a real lack of direction about why you’re there, what you’re trying to achieve, and why you should want to go anywhere beyond ‘because it’s there’, the openness of the multiple zones ends up leaving me feeling agoraphobic rather than freed. You know that eventually you’ll hit an ability wall, perhaps a chimney of rock with alternating spikes on either side, and you’ll think, “Oh, I’m going to be able to bounce off walls at some point then,” but there’s no notion of how, or where, or when, or why. There are so many dead ends to go in at once! I’m left wishing for some allusion toward direction, or at least a more meaningful motivation for such rambling. </p>, <p>All this said, it delivers on what it delivers. The movement is fast but sturdy, the combat nifty, and the artwork is really lovely. Its choice of greys and muted greens and blues doesn’t do it enormous favours, and each area is pretty monotone. Animations are great, and the world is pleasingly detailed, but it also feels flat and dulled. Again, the comparison with Ori is a heavy blow, and if you were choosing between the two it’d be another strike against.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/mar/hol06.jpg"/></p>, <p>But perhaps you’re not. Perhaps you just want to plough through another metroidvania (if only we had a better name than that), and then this is a fine game for you. It ticks most of the boxes, completely with difficulty spike bosses that make me want to carve my hate for the experience in the sides of mountains, but apparently people love those. It’s a pretty, competent, if needlessly frustrated standard of the standard. That might be just what you need.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for something <em>like</em> this, then get yourself Ori &amp; The Blind Forest, which is truly tremendous.

Gosh, we’re living in brilliant times for interesting games. It seems barely a month goes by now without something novel and fascinating appearing, pushing at the edges, upcycling old ideas for new minds, and messing with our brains. The latest that fits all these categories is the really very splendid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/Stories-Untold/">Stories Untold</a> [<a href="http://www.nocodestudio.com/">entirely pointless official site</a>], ostensibly a collection of four novella-like adventures linked by an opaque theme. It’s part parser-based text adventure, part horror peculiarity, part 80s TV show… It’s unlike anything you’ve played before, despite being built from the half-remembered remains of a childhood of gaming.</p>, <p>So a familiar caveat to accompany such a review: if you trust me, if you want to experience the game with as little information as possible so everything’s a surprise, then take the above paragraph as everything you need <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/558420">and spend £6 on this</a>. If you want more details (wonderfully written and spoiler-free), then read on.<span id="more-432125"></span></p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/stor01.jpg"/></p>, <p>The game’s store information is deliberately vague. The game’s website is blank to the point of apparently forgetting that they’ve released it. You’re meant to go into this blind. So I’ll give you the setup, then move on to the criticism.</p>, <p>It says <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/558420/">on Steam</a>,</p>, <p>“Stories Untold is a compilation tape of four experimental text adventures, including a remaster of the original episode The House Abandon.”</p>, <p>Even that isn’t quite true.</p>, <p>As you begin you’ve four chapters in a row on a title screen, only the first available to play. Each unlocks as you complete the last. And the first is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/the-house-abandon/">The House Abandon</a>, a parser-based text adventure (or “piece of interactive fiction” if you’re cool), a previously released project that has been updated for this compilation. Start it, and rather pleasingly instead of simply being presented with a screen of text, you’re presented with a screen, keyboard, lamp and desk. Type on your keyboard, text appears on that in-game monitor, and perhaps in the most superfluous sound effect in gaming history, it makes keyboard noises to match. (I WAS ALREADY MAKING KEYBOARD NOISES, GAME.)</p>, <p>Then you know what to do. You’re outside a house, in your car, there’s a glovebox.</p>, <p>&gt; OPEN GLOVEBOX</p>, <p>There’s a note and some keys. You take them.</p>, <p>&gt; LEAVE CAR</p>, <p>And so on. You’re returning to your family home after some time away (I’m not sure if the Gone Home similarity there is deliberate, but if it is, it’s not important), you need to get the power on, get inside, start looking around. Until stuff starts happening. Interesting stuff.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/stor02.jpg"/></p>, <p>The second chapter’s short game changes things rather. You’re performing experiments in a dark laboratory, following instructions on a green monochrome monitor, fiddling with hardy old machinery to conduct peculiar tests. The third sticks with the themes of monitors and following instructions, but this time in a completely different setting, with some more involved interpretation of codes. The fourth is yet again a new location, a new approach. They’re linked, but exactly how is vague, and trying to draw lines between them is an interesting aside as you’re drawn into each unique narrative.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/stor03.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are some issues along the way. When you’re using the parser interfaces there are a lot of expected basics that aren’t in place. It doesn’t seem to know basic IF commands, like “look” on its own for describing the current area, or “i” or even “inventory” for finding out what you’re holding. All IF games have frustration when they don’t recognise a term, especially when you’re using the same wording in the description, and there’s definitely too much of that here. A bit more work on guessing how a player might phrase something would improve the flow of things. And there are a fair few typos throughout, not all of which I believe are deliberate.</p>, <p>More infuriatingly, it insists on ‘teletyping’ out the text for each location even when you’re revisiting, and won’t let you type until it’s done. That’s a very odd design choice, especially when it insists on re-describing the current location if you, say, read a note. Just let me type already! And perhaps most problematic, at a certain point in the first chapter, you can only continue by entering a specific phrase which it prompted you to enter a screen or two back. Enter the phrase incorrectly and the response only tells you again to enter it, rather than reminding you what it is it demands you say. Slight variations on the phrase it wants aren’t accepted, which leads to a frustrating time of trying to remember the exact wording that appeared on screen once, and can’t be brought back.</p>, <p>My other issue is that, well, damn – I can’t really say. There are lighting problems in the third section, let’s leave it at that. Ooh, I hope that complaint has the side-effect of being intriguing.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/stor04.jpg"/></p>, <p>But back to celebrating this, because flipping heck, it’s good. It’s good because of what you’re not expecting, and if you’re annoyed that you’re now expecting something when you weren’t before, you should have trusted the second paragraph in this review. When will you learn? It’s good for all the reasons I can’t say, or I’d make them less good for you.</p>, <p>There are so many lovely details, not least the splendid opening titles sequence for each of the four segments, reminiscent of many an ‘80s TV show, with a Stranger Things-like title card to boot. There are indeed many details you won’t even know are lovely details. Ooh, it’s a bit clever.</p>, <p>(Slightly connected to that, it’s important to add a quick health warning. (For real, no gag.) Pretty much all games come with an epilepsy warning, covering their backs for those just-in-cases, which I suspect means even epileptics might have developed a habit of ignoring them. <strong>So it’s worth emphasising that Stories Untold’s epilepsy warning is for real</strong> – there’s a prolonged sequence in the game that has multiple rapidly strobing lights that isn’t to be messed around with if you’re at risk.)</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/stor05.jpg"/></p>, <p>This is smartly written, intriguingly delivered, and wonderfully unique. It’s fascinating that in the same month we’ve got two such wildly different interpretations of interactive fiction, with Night In The Woods combining the genre with platforming and bright cartoon graphics, and Stories Untold pulling it toward something equally visual, but dark, grimy, and frightening. These are splendid times to be gaming!</p>, <p>Stories Untold is bleak and disturbing, novel and experimental, and most importantly when doing all that, very clever. It’s smarter than you’ll realise, in fact. And why it’s smart is all in the experience of playing, not to be given away in the process of reviewing. A pain in the arse for me, but worth it for you.You know Planescape: Torment well, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=431785&amp;preview=true">chose</a> to hear whether Torment: Tides of Numenera will betray your trust or not rather than to have its nature defined first. </em></p>, <p>Please note that certain key elements of the game are skipped over here, which is because they are covered in more detail in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review-for-series-newcomers/">the Torment newcomers review here</a>. I did not wish to repeat myself unduly in an already long article. If you are a Planescape veteran, I do encourage reading both pieces. After all, you rather like reading, don’t you?</p>, <p>We expect certain things of a game with ‘Torment’ in the title – expectations that have mounted rather than faded over the years.<span id="more-432057"></span></p>, <p>We expect striking, sinister architecture and weird creatures of uncertain intent. </p>, <p>We expect extensive excavation of moral grey areas. </p>, <p>We expect decisions to agonise over. </p>, <p>We expect to barely raise a fist in anger, unless it is our specific choice to. </p>, <p>We expect words, not spectacle, to do the heaviest lifting. </p>, <p>We expect a mystery that unfurls into existential questioning rather than neat resolution. </p>, <p>We expect to feel that we have barely scratched the surface of possibility, and to find that our journey is fascinatingly, unpredictably different when we start it over.</p>, <p>We expect to end the tale with mingled satisfaction and despair.</p>, <p>We expect Adahn.</p>, <p>We expect what, more or less, Torment: Tides of Numenera gives us. </p>, <p>By which I mean: relax, it’s good news.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/torm12.jpg"/></p>, <p>I should say first that Numenera feels more constructed than did Planescape. It is very clearly created to give fans exactly what they demand. Because of this there is a palpable sense, at times, that its creators carefully reverse-engineered its revered 1999 predecessor, perhaps even working from an inviolable set of commandments about what makes a Torment game a Torment game. </p>, <p>Sometimes this does robe Numenera in a certain scent of artificiality, where by contrast Planescape felt organic, this shiny new mind unexpectedly breaking through the confines of the roleplaying game structures of the time. Only a little, though. Though once in a while there’s a slight clunk as it blatantly reaches to hit expected beats, in the main Numenera is exactly the game it needed to be.</p>, <p>Steam tells me one playthrough took me 36 hours, but at least some of those were spent reloading savegames to explore alternative outcomes for the sake of this review. If you plan to play this as a conversation- rather than action-led character, as I did, teasing out every thread you can find, as I did, expect to end up with something similar. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/torm3.jpg"/></p>, <p>However, I am relatively certain that one could blow through the campaign in a third of that time if side-quests were neglected and violence favoured. I recommend against this, not from a pacifistic point of view, but because Numenera is such a deft cat’s cradle, with even some of its most seemingly irrelevant fetch quests and favours containing ties to the bigger picture. In some cases this means more insight into how this place works and who your character may or may not be; in others there are moving or harrowing unexpected consequences that only reveal themselves in the long-term. </p>, <p>It is those consequences, more so than the central story (or, more specifically, it is those consequeces’ ties to the central story) that achieve the most emotional clout. Take your time here. Explore everything. Do nothing thoughtlessly. Know that your actions will be rewarded, or punished as the case may be, and anticipate that more than you do the conclusion per se. When the final act arrives, it does so somewhat abruptly and introduced by an oddly weak twist – my chief disappointment with the storytelling. </p>, <p>There is a faint sense that, perhaps, Numenera is one area shorter than it needs be – not in terms of length, but in terms of flow. I do not know if something was left on the cutting room floor or if it is simply a wobble in execution, but I did feel suddenly railroaded into climactic events before certain strands of the story and world (both deeply intertwined) had seemed fully teased out. This is not to say the absolute conclusion is weak – quite the opposite in fact, due to its remarkably thoughtful links to your choices across the course of the game, and it has scope to play out significantly differently because of that – but rather that the moment of movement into the final phase is a little jarring.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/torm9.jpg"/></p>, <p>The other disappointment (I’ll move back to praise shortly, fear not) for me was the central character. It is here that I proved most unable to push Planescape memories and attendant expectations aside. Its protagonist, The Nameless One, was immediately memorable, both in his forlorn yet determined nature and his half-monstrous, half-tragic appearance. He was walking sadness with a something deeply dangerous bubbling just underneath his scarred, grey-blue hide, and this concept of his being the risen dead, immortal despite his better wishes, spoke to true weirdness. He himself made it clear that we had side-stepped into a different reality of roleplaying games. </p>, <p>Numenera’s The Last Castoff, by contrast, is rather a more conventional figure, despite having, if anything, a more thorough and extensive backstory with profound and strange links to almost every aspect of the world they find themselves in. Though their story spirals off into singular places, in appearance, essence and even treatment by others they cleave closer to the sort of character one might find in a Dragon Age or, to be carefully specific about how this shakes out, Baldur’s Gate II. </p>, <p>My suspicion here is that more thought has been put into the Last Castoff’s story than has his or her personality. Clearly, a keystone of a Torment game is that the player can impress their own beliefs and attitudes into the tabula rasa that is their character, but even so – The Nameless One was very much The Nameless One. The Last Castoff could be anyone. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/torm7.jpg"/></p>, <p>This story-over-personality issue is particularly apparent during Numenera’s first and weakest couple of hours, which suffer from an overload of both lore and terminology (specifically, rules from the pen and paper Numenera RPG setting this game is based upon). My heart sank as I felt as though any possible points of connection with this world were being drowned out by someone’s uncensored fiction and presumed knowledge about an external game from a different medium. There were walls everywhere I turned, and I felt exhausted by the huge array of new NPCs waiting to gabble lore at me in every new area or building I entered.</p>, <p>My fear was that the whole game would be like this – that the successful Kickstarter had given the writers a blank cheque to do anything they wanted, unfiltered, uncensored, unedited, and it had resulted in wearying drone of Ideas. </p>, <p>Fortunately, this was resolved by a combination of Torment narrowing its focus to characters rather than high concepts and simple perseverance enabling me to reach through the initial babble and find the threads that mattered. Those threads are long, enmeshed with the very essence of Torment’s setting, and spin off in unexpected directions, regularly causing me to question my own actions even though I largely stuck to a philanthropic, empathetic path. </p>, <p>Depending on the choices you make – some moral, some a matter of effort and determination – seemingly inconsequential events explode into later significance. Though the Last Castoff themselves never touched or broke my heart, a couple of the characters they came into contact with did. I can say no more, you understand. Against this, other characters – by which I mean possible party members – did feel as though they were short story first, personality second, and I left them benched unless a specific situation seemed to call for them. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/torm11.jpg"/></p>, <p>A couple of companions here (and one in particular, but I shall write about them separately, later) are fit for a place in the halls of honour, but others failed to be as memorable as the cast of grotesques and unfortunates in Planescape: Torment. Everyone I met seemed to be, to all intents and purposes, a human with a tragic backstory, not the alien oddities or malevolent powderkegs of Planescape. There is no Ignus here and, most noticeably, no Morte either. </p>, <p>Two things here, mind you. One is that I was younger, more impressionable, more patient, more willing to be overcome when I played Torment. Characters that might seem less compelling now, after these tired eyes have seen, heard and read so much, were fresh and exciting then. The other is that, of course, I cannot say with any certainty that I have not missed something – someone. I look forwards to secrets I had not even guessed at being revealed. </p>, <p>When I hear about those secrets, they will doubtless turn out to be new vertebrae along Numenera’s long and twisting backbone, not diversions off to one side. The dawning realisation, as I played, of how precise this initially random-seeming weave was, is why I am in awe of what has been accomplished here. </p>, <p>The central reason for Tides of Numenera’s being is a riposte to RPG convention – that this should be a game where story, and exploration of what that story means, is of infinitely greater importance than spectacle and action. Not for this the lurid sex scene, the legendary weapon or the explosive magical lightshow. Plenty of combat (turn-based and party-based) is available if you so wish, though I found it to be rather functional and with far less fascinating consequences than talking my way out of or into trouble. </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/torm5.jpg"/></p>, <p>That is because Torments spends the bulk of its energies instead on connection and on meaning. I am avoiding details of the story, for that should be discovered for yourself, but suffice it to say there are many commonalities with the themes explored by Planescape. However, the question is not ‘what can change the nature of a man?’ but rather ‘what can change the nature of a world?’</p>, <p>The answer, of course, is ‘you.’ </p>, <p>This is an uncommonly elaborate act of videogame storytelling. At times, it leans very close to interactive fiction, while at others it carefully explores the talk down or fight formula that characterises many latter-day RPGs. I engaged in very few battles, always preferring to find a peaceable solution – if anything, Numenera is a little too built for this, and it’s too easy to become a god of conversation. By the midpoint of the game, it was a foregone conclusion that I could succeed in any conversational gambit I chose – the question was of the consequence of that choice, not whether I could pull it off in the first place. Planescape felt like a constant gamble by contrast. </p>, <p>I suppose what I’m saying is that pouring all my level-up points into cerebral skills never felt like a compromise. I am broadly happy with this, because that is the game I wanted to play, and I appreciate how finely Numenera is balanced to be a game of talking and reading rather than necessarily one of violence, but I would have felt more pull to immediately play it again had there been a more palpable sense that I had missed out on things by not choosing aggression. I may be wrong there – there may be whole strands as yet unexplored. It did not feel like it, but felt instead that I would be shutting down rather than opening up possibilities. I may be wrong.</p>, <p>Let us talk, finally, of writing and of presentation. It is a well-written game, yes – often, the quality of the words, the play of their language, the ludicrously careful interplay of their themes, filled me with both awe and envy. Other times, it all seemed flabby, too caught up in showing off ideas and colour to find the truth of its message and the heart of its characters. While once I believed that there was no greater accomplishment for a game than to contain a novel’s worth of words, these days I respect the editor’s knife almost more than I do the writer’s pen. I would prefer Numenera shorter rather than longer.</p>, <p>(He says, guiltily eyeing the ‘word count: 1871’ notification below this, and conscious that he has three other sections of this ‘review’ still to write). </p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/torm6.jpg"/></p>, <p>Nonetheless, this is a triumphant achievement in (near)mainstream games writing, and of taking fantasy themes and transforming them into the meaningfully human rather than the merely mythic. A little more small-c conservatism would have been a boon, and it takes a little too long to reach its focus, but when it does it puts most everything else in the shade.</p>, <p>It is frequently a beautiful game too, as should be expected. Technologically, it’s a few years behind the RPG pack, but I’ll take simplistic character models and 2D backdrops any day when they have this degree of fidelity. Though mostly static, the environments are huge and lavish, filled with beauty, oddity and sometimes gruesomeness. My chief excitement on progressing to a new section of the game is about what sights will sprawl across my screen. Once in a while, it even achieves relatively spectacular setpiece. </p>, <p>There is, throughout, a slight air of artificiality to Torment: Tides of Numenera. It has been made to please a specific crowd, and sometimes that shows; sometimes that comes at the expense of what matters most. This is outweighed entirely by the scale of this accomplishment. Torment is the weird, wordy, wise and wicked roleplaying game we’ve so desired during these long years of heightened spectacle. Not a total triumph, no, but close enough.</p>, <p>Our expectations have been met.

Every Monday we send Brendan to scout the early access ruins for hidden treasures. This week, the careful Viking tactics of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/northgard/">Northgard</a> [<a href="http://northgard.net/">official site</a>]</i></p>, <p>This is Blainn, below. He’s just killed a Wyvern. He’s my best mate because I gave him and his giant pals, the Jötunn, enough food to last a lifetime. They reckon we in the Goat clan are excellent humans and now Chief Blainn is fighting alongside us in our hoofed conquest of the whole land. This is one endgame that comes in Northgard, a rock-solid RTS about allocating and reallocating your Viking workforce in <i>just</i> the right way. Technically this match ended over an hour ago, when my opponent reached a “wisdom victory”. But it’s a testament to Northgard’s foundations that, when given the option to leave or continue following my defeat, I happily clicked “keep playing”.<br/>
<span id="more-431993"></span></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/PE_northgard1.jpg"/></p>, <p>Its cartoonish facade suggests a game of town building and ale-drinking. There is some of that – you need to build breweries and host feasts to keep your people happy, for example – but otherwise this is as classically expansionist and competitive as they come. There are a few ways to win. You can research the most “lore” for the aforementioned wisdom victory, you can kill all other clans for a conquest victory, or you can achieve the most notoriety by defeating monster’s lairs and raiding distant off-screen lands for a fame victory. In my own head, victory was not achieved until the whole map was coloured in red.</p>, <p>Here the land is already cut into pre-made slices. Each quadrant of the map has a resource or benefit waiting to be exploited and you can’t visit or invade one without first sending a scout to reveal the section. Some of these tiles have forests which boost the wood collected by any woodcutters there. Others have lakes where you can build fishing outposts, fertile land for farming, ruins for your treasure-seeking scouts to explore, stone or iron deposits to mine, stone circles containing “lore” (you need this to research new skills and clan-specific benefits). In other words, all the things a hearty Viking covets. Even a plot of “empty land” has the benefit of allowing you to build one extra structure there.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/PE_northgard3.jpg"/></p>, <p>That each plot has a limit on buildings is one of its smart designs – it forces decisions on you at all times. Each tile can only house two or three buildings and you quickly find yourself agonising over what to build and where. There are rock deposits in this quadrant, you reason, I’ll definitely need a mine. But I also need a healer’s hut to keep my villagers healthy, a training camp to recruit warriors AND a new house to allow more villagers to arrive at my town hall. Without houses, the clan can’t grow, without warriors we can’t defend ourselves against encroaching wolves, draugr and other clans, and without healers those warriors will quickly die.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/PE_northgard4.jpg"/></p>, <p>This can be solved by being an expansionist pig. Colonising new areas requires a large down payment of food, so it too is a costly choice, especially in the later stages as each successive tile becomes more expensive as you grow. But it’s an obvious necessity, not only because unclaimed tiles might have delicious resources but also because you just badly need the lebensraum. Growth is on your mind at all times and there never seems like enough room to build everything you want, as you discover via your scouts that you’re hemmed into a corner of the map by wolf lairs, draugr tombs, giants’ camps, canyons, ocean, and enemy clans.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/PE_northgard7.jpg"/></p>, <p>I can’t tell if the maps are being randomly generated or if there’s a library of set geography with randomised tile contents. If it’s the former, then its an incredible map-maker – all the islands I played on had chokepoints, strategic lynchpins, wealthy areas, centralised goals (a legendary Wyvern to fight for fame and glory, for instance, or a portal to hell that will win you the game outright if you can control it for 12 months running). If the maps are predesigned and fashioned with randomised elements, then they are still very well made, geographically speaking. Each starting area always seemed to be purposefully cramped but in its own way that also meant it could be easily defended from monsters in the early game. As for rival clans, the need to explore the island tile by tile means that there are no rushed invasions or skirmish parties heading out across the map. In fact, even if you can see a rival clan’s home tile, your warriors can’t delve that deep into a foe’s turf. You can’t capture or colonise <em>any</em> tile without already owning one adjacent to it. This isn’t an RTS of speed, it’s more one of thoughtful resource management and prioritising.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/PE_northgard9.jpg"/></p>, <p>Your workforce is always central to any plan. Villagers slowly get pooped out of the town hall at your home tile and <i>only</i> at your home tile. Distance is always an issue and over-reaching is as much a threat as the monsters in the tile next to you. Multiple times I sent warriors to an unwise death and realised that I didn’t have the manpower to replace them, and even if I could the tiles they were most needed in were so far away and already under attack on by two different enemies that I wasn’t able to hold them all.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/PE_northgard5.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s a game of cautiously plucking people and reassigning their life’s work to suit you. Even so, you need to be careful with your wee folks because even a few deaths can knock you entirely off course. Your warriors die and you scramble to recruit new ones, so you have to take some woodcutters off their lumberjacking duty, which is fine for now, but still you might not have enough troops, so you recruit a farmer and a fisherman. Food might be tight, you think, but never mind, you need the soldiers because some portals to Helheim have opened and you’ll need men to deal with that come the winte– <i>oh s***, winter. </i></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/PE_northgard6.jpg"/></p>, <p>You see, there’s a small rolling calendar in one corner of your screen and when winter arrives the frost comes with it. Both wood and food deplete at a faster rate. Farms produce less and your warriors can’t fight as well in areas that don’t yet belong to you, suffering a combat penalty in the snow. It’s there on the ticking calendar, a little white bar that you roll through every year but still you sometimes fail to prepare correctly. One hasty colonisation in September can be a thoughtless drain on your food stocks. One round of upgrades to your houses and one rash building of a longship might see you run out of firewood prematurely.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/PE_northgard8.jpg"/></p>, <p>In these cases people will likely become unhappy, which in turn causes them to produce less in their jobs. Then they begin to starve or die in the cold. “Well at least the houses are all very roomy now,” you might think. But before you know it winter is over and you have six fewer villagers to work with and the posh houses you just built are lying completely empty. Six deaths may not sound like a lot but in Northgard it can be devastating to your growth. And this is just a description of bad planning during a normal winter. Sometimes there are blizzards, winters so harsh that your food dwindles like it’s being eaten by rats. Sometimes <em>it is</em> being by rats, because that’s another type of disaster that shows up, along with the hell portals and whiteouts.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/PE_northgard12.jpg"/></p>, <p>These disasters always appear in good time though, as a little red exclam on your calendar. You just need to get into the habit of preparation and over-compensating for everything, having contingency plans, keeping your expansions in check with your capabilities. The only complaint I have with these is that there’s sometimes an earthquake disaster which sets many of your buildings on fire at once. The idea is that you need to quickly repair them and hope you have enough wood to repair them all. In practice, this is just an unpleasant clickathon, finding each individual burning edifice and clicking repair as quickly as you can, like playing whackamole with burning food silos. I would always have enough wood and if a building got destroyed in the post-quake fires it was always because I had too many buildings to click on, or simply didn’t spot one of them in my hasty glancing-over of the map. The other disasters and foreshadowed threats feel strong and concerning. The earthquake is the only one that feels both weak and annoying to deal with, purely from a mouse user’s point of view.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/PE_northgard10.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are other downsides. Right now there’s still only a skirmish mode. It’s strong stuff, well worth a play for anyone hankering for some thoughtful arr-tee-essing. But it’s also sad that the campaign mode remains greyed out, slotted for some future update. Likewise multiplayer is currently non-existent. This is a strategy game that I feel will thrive online like a well-watered plant, providied it is also fed enough human waste. Playing with a few enemy AI clans on the normal difficulty can give you a good run but I imagine many will only lament the lack of a multiplayer when they see how tightly-woven the game itself is. Not me, obviously. I like my casual stroll over the map, plonking down altars and longboats and assigning little men to learn about better swords from giant runestones.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/PE_northgard11.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s an impressively well-made thing, a finely-embroidered cloak of an RTS with all the elements sewn together in a pleasing and sensible way. Most importantly, the immediate environment around your home feels like it really influences your strategy for the whole match. I once spawned in an area with three hunting grounds and a fishing lake nearby, but very little woodland or stone. I had to base my entire economy on stag fillet, placing food silos in every quadrant and blocking off access to our home canyon by quickly colonising a coastal passage into our land. From this position I could trade my plentiful food with both the peaceful giants and other AI players I discovered. From here you can use the money to buy materials in a marketplace (this building slowly accumulates wood, food, iron, and stone which you can buy for coin). In the long run, this is much more expensive than mining stone or chopping wood yourself but sometimes in the early and mid-game it is the best option. I later betrayed my trading partners and murdered them. They stopped buying stag fillets.</p>, <p>Eventually, the game ended when I got a wisdom victory of my own (one minor complaint is that this always seems to be the easiest route to victory). I had researched my little Viking heart out and achieved all the blessings of the gods. But, tellingly, I still clicked “keep playing”.

At one point I was sure I was going to write about how much I disliked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/night-in-the-woods/">Night In The Woods</a> [<a href="http://www.nightinthewoods.com/">official site</a>]. At a later point I realised I was going to write about how much I loved Night In The Woods. I think there’s a lot to know about Night In The Woods from that. It is both extraordinary and wanting, fantastic and frustrating. It’s a story you click through, yet features platform-based dream sequences. It’s defiantly linear, yet seems to offer moments of enormous choice. It’s perplexing, wide-ranging, specifically brilliant and specifically half-baked. The writing is sharp and intriguing, yet mono-voiced and peculiar. It’s a visual novel, but it’s a platform game, but it’s an adventure, but it’s something else entirely. I’m pretty sure I love it at this point.<span id="more-431707"></span></p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/nig06.jpg"/></p>, <p>I love that this is a game where you can spend the moment right before bed sat watching a crappy TV show with your dad. That it’s a game where genuine conversations take place sat on benches by rivers after nights where everything’s gone to shit. That it’s a game where a fight with your mum feels <em>awful</em>, something that <em>has</em> to be patched up. Where you start to care about the lives of characters with whom you barely interact, just catching snippets of their day in overheard conversations. Where a small town is slowly being taken apart by poverty, and this feels meaningful yet in the background, not preached at you or underlined. Where the game changes with every in-game day, as Autumn gets more Autumny. It’s bigger and better than I believed for even hours after I started playing.</p>, <p>I’ve come away from it with memories, in the weirdest sense. Like, I find myself thinking fondly back on that daft evening in the near-abandoned shopping mall, and the fountain. Even though at the time of that scene I was still wondering if I was ever going to find the way to like this game. I think that scene was a big part of why I started to.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/nig03.jpg"/></p>, <p>You play as Mae, a 20 year old humanoid cat who has just dropped out of college and moved back to her hometown, into her parents’ house. (Quite whether you’re <em>actually</em> a cat is a matter of some confusion, since your friends appear to be bears, crocodiles, foxes and the like, but no one specifically mentions this, and more confusingly there are – er – felinoid cats trotting about the neighbourhood as pets.) Something happened at college, and you’re not telling anyone what it is. And indeed something happened at highschool, and you’re not willing to let anyone talk about it – just that you apparently put someone in hospital. Mae has clearly had some trouble in her childhood, and seems to be doing her best to drag it into her adulthood.</p>, <p>As for what the game’s actually about, so much of the eventual plot appears so late into the game that it feels inappropriate to describe it. I think here the aimlessness, the lack of a sense of direction, or understanding about where it might be going, is a lot of the point. It reflects Mae’s state of mind, if being a lot less erratic and haphazard than in her head.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/nig09.jpg"/></p>, <p>And this is also the game’s initial weakness. I maintain that this isn’t a game that starts well. It looks just utterly wonderful from the first moment, and remains visually wondrous throughout – there’s no questioning that. But as for your involvement – it’s, well, minimal. For too long your role is simply to press ‘next’. I reached a point after hours of this where I thought, “I would absolutely watch this TV show, but I really resent being asked to crank a handle to do so.”</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/nig12.jpg"/></p>, <p>Then, definitely too late, it begins to stretch out. This has been labelled a “visual novel”, an essentially meaningless term that is usually used to describe dating sims so far as I can tell, but here means, “a story it’s going to tell you whether you like it or not”. And very often I pick “like it” when games give me that non-choice. But usually because there’s a bit more involvement in-between the dialogue. Of course, I’d not have these issues if the game were text on a black background, and I realise my own biases play a big part here. NITW eventually starts to make more of Mae’s jumpy-jumpy abilities, both in exploring the higher parts of the neighbourhood and in peculiar dream sequences, and while it’s never actually a proper platformer, it at least gives the delusion of participation as its story becomes more interesting and focused. It also has an array of mini-games, even including a shop-lifting challenge. Oh, and Mae’s computer has a complete dungeon crawler roguelite on it!</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/nig11.jpg"/></p>, <p>Mae is one of the most interesting player characters of recent times. She makes bad choices at a professional level, and is fortunate to have friends as good as those she does. The relationships with her chums, all members of a band she plays in (which offers some wildly incongruous Guitar Hero-style sequences where you’re given properly difficult challenges for songs you’ve never heard before), are by far the most interesting aspect of the game, each relating to Mae’s madcap approach to reality in their own way.</p>, <p>But I’m also convinced she’s a weirdly written 20 year old. For a great deal of the time she behaves something closer to 12, seemingly as unaware of the world as 12 year old might be. Sometimes this works, sometimes it stretches credulity. That she’s unwilling or unable to let go of her teenage years is apparent and deliberate, but I think it reaches too far into that, breaks the frame a little with overwritten silliness. I imagine that’s a contentious point, and others will argue I’m wrong – it’s a fine line, certainly, but one with which I think the game is a little too eager to take liberties.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/nig18.jpg"/></p>, <p>Which brings us to another odd issue. The writing is lovely, and just so good in so many ways. But it’s written with one voice. Everyone is dryly witty in exactly the same way, the same sense of humour shared across the main cast, both Mae’s parents, the local vicar, a grumpy guy you bug in the street… It’s a voice I enjoy (although one I can absolutely see deeply grating with others), but it does start to feel a bit ridiculous spread across an entire town of wry sarcasm.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/nig05.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are some technical issues too. Interactive pop-up zones are often too small to react to when moving. Your character runs to the left, and by the time you’ve reacted to the little bubble telling you there’s something to look at, you’ve gone past it and have to backtrack. A lot. Such an easily identified issue, if you only watch people playing your game. And the jumping, necessary for finding all the game’s hidden extras, is a touch wonky.</p>, <p>Worse though are those earlier scenes where the game works too hard at implying choice, and providing none. At a certain point you’re at a party in the woods, old school friends, old school enemies, and a keg of beer. Mae hasn’t drunk beer before, and so she faces the dilemma of being in an awkward social situation, there’s an ex by the fire, and everyone else is chatting in pairs. She could drink, she could not drink. Chatting to others, some suggest she have a bit more, others warn her not to. So a classic gaming situation where you approach the situation in your own way, right? Nothing wrong with a few beers at a party, she’s 20, it’s how many of us make such an evening a little easier to get through. And nothing wrong with not drinking at a party, she’s not a drinker, and getting drunk is something many of us find uncomfortable or unpleasant. Except no, it’s not a choice. Once you exhaust the conversation options, the only thing left to do is drink more. That’s the story the game’s telling, dammit, and forget your own thoughts about it!</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/nig10.jpg"/></p>, <p>This improves as the extraordinarily long game continues, but more by changing how it offers choice. By a combination of fewer scenes where you mistakenly feel like you’re about to be offered a decision, and an acceptance that Mae is always going to make the worst choices imaginable, that fades away. And instead you are given much larger, more obvious choices – how to spend your evening, for instance. Do you go off with Bae, the hardened, grieving, stoic croc who will attempt to temper Mae’s wild instincts, or Gregg the fox, a manic and daft childhood best friend who encourages Mae to go smash stuff with him? Maybe you take a calmer time with Gregg’s gentle, quiet boyfriend, Angus, a bespectacled bear. Or you could ditch them all one night and hang out with a highschooler mouse you find sitting on the rooftops.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/nig07.jpg"/></p>, <p>The art and animations deserve accolades to rain down upon them. The striking style is gorgeous and wonderful, and it never stops being a joy to look at. It’s certainly a shame that they (presumably coincidentally) opted for the same speech bubble style and incredibly similar font as Oxenfree, as it invites a comparison that is perhaps unfavourable. Essentially, Oxenfree is the superior game, and it might not be such an immediate urge to compare the two were it not for this similarity.</p>, <p>But the most fantastic detail is the animation. Character movement is fabulous, and Mae’s sproingy arms and legs as she jumps about are a constant pleasure. Everyone’s movement is just stunning, and so subtly done. But even more subtle is the use of tiny, tiny details, little blinks or twitches of an ear, that are delivered with exquisite timing. It’s hard to convey in text how much this adds, but the enormous effort that must have gone in to get this so right has absolutely paid off.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/nig14.jpg"/></p>, <p>As for where it ends… I’m not sure. Clearly I’m not even going to hint, but I’ve come away deciding to reinterpret a huge sway of the final act in order that it can not be what I strongly suspect it really was. It just about gives me room to do that, too, so that’s neat. But still. It’s a shame, and why can be expanded upon elsewhere, where it won’t ruin the game.</p>, <p>So yeah, I started off really not liking it, I grew to completely love it, and I walk away from it with so much love but a wobble of doubt. It’s by far the most elaborately graphical piece of interactive fiction, but in being so it suggests it’s going to be other things too, and it’s hard (certainly at first) to let go of all that, just let it be what it is. Get there, forget about what else it might be, and for me at least, it got me good.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/nig17.jpg"/></p>, <p>I have so, <em>so</em> much more to say about it, and it feels mad that I only really mention the three friends so far into this review, then don’t talk about them. But that’s important, that’s me remembering to allow you the same blank slate I started with too. I want to talk about the role of religion, about the complexities of the town’s politics, about Mae’s relationship with her parents, about just so many things. But another time.

I’ll avoid open spoilers here (you can find those, and our thoughts on them, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/07/resident-evil-7-spoilers-review/">here</a>, if you’re so minded), but suffice it to say that the final act of Resident Evil 7 Biohazard [<a href="http://residentevil7.com/uk/index.html#_top">official site</a>] is not the equal of the claustrophobic cat and mouse chase/escape room mash-up that makes the rest of the game such a terrifying triumph. It is, then, a relief to find that the first two rounds of DLC, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/21/resident-evil-7-banned-footage-dlc-pc-release-today/">now available on PC</a> after temporary PlayStation imprisonment, broadly mark a return to what made the Baker house such a successful reinvention of the Resi formula.</p>, <p><span id="more-431141"></span></p>, <p>I’ll do this as set of capsule reviews, seeing as the DLC is divided into, essentially, mini-games. It’s also currently sold in two parts, unless you splurged on the season pass, known as Banned Footage Volume 1 and Volume 2. Annoyingly, both have exceptional elements and both have entirely disposable elements, so there’s no easy ‘buy this one over the other one’ answer here.</p>, <p>The £8 pack comprises…</p>, <p><strong>Nightmare</strong></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/resd2.jpg"/></p>, <p>You know how all the routine monster-shooting was the best bit of Resi 7? No, me either. Anyway, this is that, framed within a wave-based survival structure. I guess it’s for people who felt the pace of Resi 7 was too slow and not Resident Evilly enough. It’s the no-brainer inclusion, but exactly the sort of thing one would expect to find as a bonus mode in the main game, rather than as part of a paid add-on. It’s fine for what it is, sure, but it’s the exact opposite of what makes Resi 7 Resi 7.</p>, <p><strong>Ethan Must Die</strong></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/resd6.jpg"/></p>, <p>Something of a hybrid of the better elements of the Resi 7 main campaign and Nightmare above, this is a combat-focused remix of some sections of the Baker house, culminating in a boss fight. Consciously brutally hard, its entails gradually building up your arsenal and scavenging for resources that, unlike in the main game, are randomly-placed to some degree. It’s more interesting than Nightmare for sure, and likely to be of particular appeal to those who immediately replayed the campaign on Madhouse difficulty after completing it once, but I want to be surprised rather than face trial by fire, hence didn’t stick with this for long.</p>, <p><strong>Bedroom</strong></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/resd3.jpg"/></p>, <p>The clear highlight of the first bundle, this takes the Saw torture-puzzle ethos of the Lucas section of the campaign and pairs it with the bio-horror and intense menace of the Jack and Marguerite parts. </p>, <p>It’s a prequel to the main story, and shows us more of what happened to Clancy, the doomed cameraman seen in one of the found footage tapes (and the demo). He awakens in one of the bedrooms, chained to the bed and with a rictus-grinning Marguerite delivering some unspeakably foul broth for him to eat. Then she leaves, at which point you can attempt to make your escape by finding, combining and deciphering items within the room. However, certain of your efforts trigger her to return, activating a short window of time in which you must attempt to conceal all evidence of your incomplete breakout. </p>, <p>It’s a fabulous idea, playing with the memorisation challenges that have long been part and parcel of Resi games, but making them a logical part of the dark fantasy. Even though, by now, Marguerite should be a known quantity, the terror of her impending approach, followed by her suspicious checking of the room to see if anything is out of order, is right up there with Resi 7’s heaviest-hitting moments of terror. </p>, <p>Sadly it’s all too brief and only stands up to one playthrough, realistically. I’d definitely be up for a dedicated bundle of a half dozen vignettes like this, though. It utilises and clearly understands exactly what it has in Resi 7’s best element – the twisted Baker family – and keeps its hands clean of the excess that characterises Resi 7’s final act. </p>, <p>The £12 pack comprises…</p>, <p><strong>Jack’s 55th Birthday</strong></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/resd4.jpg"/></p>, <p>I’m in two minds about this one. On the one hand, a comic-toned time attack affair feels vaguely in keeping with the kind of bonus modes of Resis yore, although once again it’s uncomfortable to find it in a paid add-on rather than unlocked at the end of the main game. On the other hand, this treats Resi 7’s most unsettling character, Jack Baker, as essentially farcical. Every time we see Jack in the light, his powers are weakened. Even within this DLC package, we have a mode in which Jack is supposed to be terrifying, so turning him into a hungry lump in a party hat here is a risky gambit.</p>, <p>But it works, more or less. You, as Mia, have to dash around various parts of the Baker house, trying to find food for Jack before the timer expires. You’ll run into increasing numbers of Resi 7’s disposable monsters as you do (many in funny hats themselves), and there’s a vaguely Call of Duty: Zombies structure here, whereby there’s limited ammo and you gradually unlock more weapon types as you play. </p>, <p>It’s all very silly and entirely throwaway, but there is an appropriate edge of mania to it, as an otherwise stationary Jack slams his fists on the table and demands <em>more</em>, while you sprint about, terrified not of the monsters themselves, but of the delay they represent. Something of the sadism of the Bakers glints through the broad comedy. On the other hand, it misses a key trick by making the food you have to find entirely ordinary, rather than the tubs of unspeakable <em>parts</em> that we are treated to distressing close-ups of elsewhere in Resi 7.</p>, <p><strong>Daughters</strong></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/resd5.jpg"/></p>, <p>The centrepiece of Banned Footage 2 and, realistically, of the whole DLC boogaloo to date. Daughters is mini-campaign, set before the events of Resi 7 proper. You should not play it if you haven’t finished the main campaign, and to even talk about it, I need to do this:</p>, <p><strong>SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS</strong></p>, <p>The thrust of Daughters is witnessing the transformation of the Bakers from more-or-less happy family and into the monsters we know and fear. We see their kindness as they bring Eveline in from the storm, we show their rickety home before it’s coated in a patina of absolute filth, and we see Zoe’s terror as her beloved parents mutate into twisted horrors. This DLC very much capitalises on Resi 7’s strongest elements, which is to say the mingled terror and tragedy of the Baker parents. </p>, <p>However, it also shines unfortunate light on some of Resi 7’s weaker aspects, as well as revealing a game that’s beginning to strain against the limits of its simple systems. Playing as an as-yet infection-free Zoe, your goal is to escape the house while evading your newly-superpowered parents. Though this marks a welcome return to the paranoia and mostly combat-free early hours of Resi 7, it also means a less welcome to its rather arbitrary stealth systems, where success can depend on enemies inexplicably not seeing you when you’re three feet away but failure can result from a total inability to lean or peer and thus requiring sprints-of-faith. </p>, <p>Its multiple endings also depend on that other Resi 7 bugbear, only being allowed to pick up a handful of objects, and in this case the ‘true’ ending even hinges on finding and using those objects in a specific order. That’s fine in as much as it gives reasons to replay this 40-ish minute long tale a couple of times, but, coming off the back of the main campaign too, it makes Resi 7’s inner workings a little too obvious and a little too artificial now.</p>, <p>Still, this is broadly an excellent extra slice of Resi 7, returning the Bakers to their deserved front-and-centre placement, making them menacing all over again – as well as their traditional jump-scare behaviour, they’re extra-monstrous because of how brutally they treat their own daughter. Given that this is the earliest moments of their transformation, we also get to see flashes of horror at their own behaviour, and it’s heartbreaking. Pointedly, Daughters fails to even mention the faintly tiresome Eveline backstory, keeping its focus tight on the Baker household. </p>, <p>Adam felt that Resi 7 itself did a fine job of conveying the tragedy and lost humanity of the Bakers, but I felt that was too little, too glibly. Daughters absolutely fixes that, but I can’t help but feel that it would have been far more valuable if included in the main campaign, as one of its flashback sequences, rather than a free-floating cast-off like this.</p>, <p><strong>21</strong></p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/21re7dlcb.jpg"/></p>, <p>After Marguerite in Bedroom and Jack in Birthday, sadistic son Lucas gets his turn in the sun. This is Blackjack by way of Saw, with you as long-suffering cameraman Clancy facing off against another Baker victim, Hoffman, in the playing cards version of Russian roulette. Whoever loses a round loses a finger, with further tortures introduced in later stages. It’s simple but effective, turning the inherent dilemma of whether to stick or draw as you try to stay under the magic 21 into something deeply traumatic. However, it’s diminishing returns following the gruesomeness of the finger-slicing initial stages, and there’s far too much sub-Joker prattle from Lucas, who remains the least compelling of the Baker clan. I think he wears his malevolence on his sleeve to his own detriment, whereas the fewer words and more opaque intent of his parents keep them deeply unsettling to the last. Still, this does a solid job of making a card game feel like a real part of the Resi 7 theme, and I enjoyed/was distressed by it far more than I’d expected.</p>, <p>So, is all this worth twenty quid? I wouldn’t say so. You could blow through it all in three hours, and it’s unlikely that you’d play most of it ever again. The only elements of it that I’d say you even need to see are Bedroom and Daughters, but even those are one-shot affairs.</p>, <p>However, given that the 25 quid season pass contains this and some as-yet unspecified further story-based DLC, it’s probably going to turn out to be better bang for your antique coin. What, in the main, all this has achieved is to restore the Bakers to a position of wildly menacing prominence, something that the closing hours of Resi 7 had unfortunately undermined, and for that I’m grateful.

Unexplored [<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/506870/">Steam page</a>] generates some of the best dungeons I’ve ever seen. On my best run so far, I forged a sword of despair and enemies trembled and fled when I pointed it in their general direction. On my most entertaining run, a Dagger of Shrieking fused itself to my hand. Every twenty seconds or so, it would scream, alerting every bastard thing in the dungeon to my presence.</p>, <p>So many roguelikes (and lites), so little time. What a pleasure it is, then, to find Unexplored, a new dungeon-crawler that immediately stands out from the pack, and that can be played swiftly and without too much time spent on the learning curve. It’s a wonderful game that creates my favourite procedural levels since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/Invisible-Inc/">Invisible, Inc</a>.</p>, <p><span id="more-431289"></span></p>, <p>Unexplored might end up being one of my favourite games of 2017. I’m going to say that up front so that it can be in the back of your mind as I talk through my initial reservations, all of which subsided very quickly. It’s important to note them though because I think a lot of people will have similar doubts and I’m here to tell you that it’s OK. It’s worth getting to grips with the idiosyncracies, which range from a few awkward interface issues right up to the fact that it plays out in real-time, because the game that contains them is such a pleasure to play.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/unexplored1.jpg"/></p>, <p>Let’s get these out of the way then. The interface is mostly great: you don’t need to learn lots of keyboard controls because most things are right click to examine, left click to use. The downside is that the screen is a bit cluttered, with the inventory taking up a big chunk of the right hand side, and yet still needing to be expanded if you want to dig deep into your pockets. It only took me fifteen minutes to accept that I’d be doing some sorting every now and again, shifting usable items to the visible top layer and dumping spare equipment into the hidden depths, but inventory management seemed troublesome because of the other big stumbling block…</p>, <p>Unexplored is a real-time roguelike. Oh no, I thought when I first started playing, everything is moving at the same time and now I am dizzy and frightened. It’s fine though. More than fine, in fact; it’s great.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/unexplored2.jpg"/></p>, <p>The combat system is a bit like a realtime version of Deadly Rooms of Death. Your weapon sticks out in front of your character and you can walk into enemies to stab them. Many are rightly wary of your blade and will try to circle around you or retreat, knowing that once you strike the weapon is grayed out briefly, harmless during its cool-down. As well as poking at creatures, you can click a mouse button to use whatever is in your hands – left button for one hand, right for the other – which allows you to thrust, throw or swing, depending on your weapon of choice. These attacks are stronger but can leave you more exposed.</p>, <p>It’s a system that allows for slow-paced combat, as much about positioning as stats, that can also escalate into panicked thrashing and fleeing when swarms of spiders or a single giant boss enemy attack. Shields can be raised to block, or weapons can be dual-wielded. Magical staffs provide ranged support in the off-hand and torches can be used to light your way as well as to ignite enemies, pools of oil or clouds of gas.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/unexplored3.jpg"/></p>, <p>I found one other aspect of the game off-putting at first, and that’s the character design. For reasons I couldn’t fathom, all player characters are one-eyed folks and I didn’t particularly like the look of them. Like everything else that made me frown, I soon understood the reason behind this decision though, and it’s simple and quite elegant. A one-eyed character, viewed from above with the eye front and centre of the head, is extremely easy to read, in terms of their position and the direction they’re facing. That, combined with the pointiness of equipped weaponry, makes controlling with a combination of keyboard for movement and mouse for targeting simple and efficient. No matter how cluttered the screen might be, the essentials are easy to read.</p>, <p>All of those initial reservations weren’t just batted aside; I love the parts of Unexplored I was unsure about when I first started playing. And the rest, the actual RPG design that’s at the heart of it all, is tremendous.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/unexplored4.jpg"/></p>, <p>I’m so accustomed to dungeons that look like they could have been mapped out on graph paper, corridors and big blocky rooms strung together with no sense of being places that were constructed by anyone for any purpose, that Unexplored is a revelation. Every level I’ve seen has its own identity, with outdoor areas, void-straddling bridges and floating islands, underground lakes and lava spills, and temples, storehouses and barracks. The developers have made a very short video talking about the science of their approach.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wvkTT-6P3Q?ecver=1" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>Read more about how it works <a href="http://ctrl500.com/tech/handcrafted-feel-dungeon-generation-unexplored-explores-cyclic-dungeon-generation/">right here</a>, and look at the maps in the top left of my screenshots. No grids and no obvious copy-and-paste rooms.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/unexplored5.jpg"/></p>, <p>What all of that means, in practice, is that each level is structurally interesting, without too much backtracking, and can happily accommodate smart little puzzles. I’ve encountered levels with one big boss and rooms full of minions, and others were there’s barely a fight to be had, but lots of libraries to loot. Others are packed with traps, or weird little signs that may or may not be cryptic clues. And those cryptic clues might lead to crypts, full of undead warriors waiting to wake. </p>, <p>Often you’ll need to find a clue to figure out how to open secret doors or chests, and clues and keys might be a level above or below the target location, so backtracking is sometimes involved. Levels are small though, so it’s never too much of a drag heading back up a couple of floors, especially if your findings have tipped you off about a big reward in the form of some neat magical weapon.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/unexplored6.jpg"/></p>, <p>And you’ll want that magical weapon because equipment is the only real way to improve your character. There’s no levelling and every hero begins as a classless ball of potential. The one important stat is strength (these dungeons are no place for a Charisma 18 arts graduate like me), determining which weapons and armour you can use without detriment. But strength doesn’t increase as you kill monsters, you have to find potions or equipment that buff your buffness.</p>, <p>It works beautifully, forcing you to explore and to try and solve puzzles and sneak by or kill enemies so you can find every last item on every level. Because there are no experience points, there’s no incentive to kill everything; instead, you can use the stealth system to sneak by, or just outsmart them and trap them in their own dungeon by hitting levers to trigger traps or locking doors. By removing the linear path toward Mighty Hero Status, Unexplored’s character-building is similar to its procedural dungeon generation: there are many routes and unexpected detours, and success comes from a combination of improvising with whatever is at hand, and choosing from the paths available.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/unexplored7.jpg"/></p>, <p>Long-term, there are options to unlock for new starts, allowing you to experiment with a form of classes, and to buy more equipment at the beginning of a run. It’s in the brief, individual adventures that Unexplored excels though. The novel approach to dungeon layouts and character-building makes all of the spider-smashing and key-hunting feel fresh. I play so many games of this type that the line between one and the next is often blurred. That makes it almost impossible for new games to find a spot on my regular roguelike playlist, but Unexplored has claimed one. </p>, <p>A single criticism remains, and that is a desire for more variety, in the form of enemy types and themed floors. It’s not that the game is repetitive but I’m already expecting to spend months caught up in its traps and I want the surprises to keep on coming.</p>, <p>I’ll finish how I started: Unexplored is almost certainly going to be one of my favourite games of the year.

How much of yourself would you sacrifice to create a literary masterpiece? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/Bucket-Detective/">Bucket Detective</a> [<a href="http://www.thewhalehusband.com/">official site</a>], the new game from the creator of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/12/10/black-comedy-game/">The Static Speaks My Name</a>, is not interested in the answer to that question. Instead, it asks what you, in the role of forty-one year old man David Davids, will give up to write a trashy book that’s sure to get you laid. Since seeing each of the endings, the discovery of which is largely based on the answer to the question “how far will you go?”, I’ve settled on a single word that captures my feelings about Bucket Detective.</p>, <p>Grubby. It’s a grubby little thing, for better and for worse.</p>, <p><span id="more-430915"></span></p>, <p>If you’ve played The Static Speaks My Name, you’ll have some idea of what to expect. Like its predecessor, Bucket Detective is a short-form first-person adventure that concerns itself with mental health, art and obsession. It’s also a comedy, at least in part, though even some of its most obvious gags are queasy.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/bucketd5.jpg"/></p>, <p>When I wrote about The Static Speaks My Name, I described it as a comedy and a couple of comments expressed confusion about that. Even people who like the game have told me that they didn’t find it funny, and weren’t convinced that it was meant to be. I find humour in these games because they’re so absurd, using a framework of clear objectives to draw out the desires and failings of their characters. The punchlines might be as painful or awkward as an unwarranted medical procedure, and perhaps the laughter is a coping mechanism, but Static did get a few proper laughs from me.</p>, <p>Bucket Detective less so. Part of the strength of Static was its setting. Absurdity and dread are more effective when placed against a backdrop of normality, and the protagonist’s home is oh-so ordinary except in the places that it isn’t. The pleasure, and horror, is in teasing out all the loose threads in that space to find how far the apparent normality will unravel. In Bucket Detective, player character David Davids is involved in such a bizarre quest from the intro onward that normality has already unravelled.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/bucketd2.jpg"/></p>, <p>He’s a grotesque figure, David. An intro, narrated through a voiceover speaking in fractured grammar and backed by ugly drawings of ugly people, tells of his ambition to write a bestselling novel because “famous book make it impossible for girls to resist sex”. The idea that writing a book called Bucket Detective might be a route to a decadent rockstar lifestyle is laughable in itself, but when a mate explaions that he knows of a cult that can make the semi-literate David a top author, the entire story dives headlong into stranger waters.</p>, <p>The setup allows for a fairly simple series of puzzles. The entire playable portion of the game takes place in a single building where David (and you) follow instructions, which appear as if by magic on a piece of paper that looks like an appointment card. In a strong opening, the first message and its simple objective backfire pathetically, but events quickly become more sinister. Potted plants vibrate, some rooms are rotting, blood sacrifices are demanded.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/bucketd3.jpg"/></p>, <p>As you learn more about the cult and its two founders, what should make the game work is David’s oblivious determination. You can choose to leave at any time but forging ahead through humiliation and pain seems like a very David thing to do, and even if you flee, David learns nothing from the experience. As you’re picking up on the very blatant clues as to the true nature of the cult, through recordings made by its most naive and innocent member as well as visual cues, you’re essentially peeling back the face to reveal the skull. David doesn’t care what’s under the skin though, as long as he can have lots of sex with lots of girls when the price has been paid. And if that price is self-mutilation or worse (much worse), so be it.</p>, <p>By the end, by which I mean the ending that takes the most time to unlock, Bucket Detective has mixed real horrors with imagined horrors. On one level it could be read as a story about the manipulation of greedy, lustful, apathetic people for terrible ends, but there’s also a joke in there about the kind of person who will drive twenty miles to save a quid on their petrol. Even though I chuckled and winced, Bucket Detective never amused or disturbed me in the way that Static did.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/bucketd4.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s that lack of grounding I’ve already written about that left me a little too distant. David is such a ludicrous idiot that stepping into his shoes is just an excuse to use him as a punching bag, something that the game acknowledges, and when other characters elicit more sympathy with a few seconds of screen-time, there’s no space to step outside David and away from his grim, grubby little path. If the scenery along that path were more interesting that’d be fine, but I never had that sense of the curtain pulling back to reveal the machinery of the world, or of horror and hilarity escalating.</p>, <p>All of that said, I’m glad that Barksdale is making these twisted little stories. The Static Speaks My Name impressed me because I never quite knew which way it <em>was</em> going to twist, whereas Bucket Detective is soaking in its own horrible juices right from the start. It starts ugly and ends ugly, without enough humour or horror in between to shock or surprise. I’m not convinced its mingling of arcane silliness and actual suffering quite works either; it’s a bit like Martyrs with gross sex jokes.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/bucketd1.jpg"/></p>, <p>But it does have a couple of fun puzzles that aren’t too taxing, and has one great joke about indefinite articles that made me laugh out loud, so I can’t complain too much.

Every Monday Brendan prays to the gods of early access for favour, power and a winning hand. This week, the collectible card game battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/smite-tactics/">Smite Tactics</a> [<a href="https://www.smitetactics.com/">official site</a>]</em></p>, <p>Being a fan of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/duelyst/">Duelyst</a>’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/02/the-dumbest-multiplayer-fight-ive-ever-had/">card-based lunacy</a>, I was more than happy to dip my toes into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/smite-tactics/">Smite Tactics</a> at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/01/16/smite-tactics-preview/">Pip’s suggestion</a>. It’s a spin-off CCG from the makers of the same-named MOBA, using their collected gods and mythical figureheads to get you collecting cards instead of pushing mid. Sadly, it’s as skeletal as an argonaut’s worst nightmare, in dire need of some fleshing out.<br/>
<span id="more-430723"></span></p>, <p>As a tactical game, the basics are straightforward and recognisable to any Hearthstone dabbler. You get a handful of cards, some are spells and some are creatures that you can summon (or heroes or gods etc). Each creature has numbers denoting their attack strength and health. Every attack (or almost every attack) will prompt a counterattack from the targeted monster. It’s more or less a game of small numbers, random luck and tempo, getting into a position to do slightly more damage than your foe at critical moments. You’ve also got your principal God on the same battlefield. You need to kill the opposing God to win, chipping away at their larger health pool until one of you snuffs it.</p>, <p>The difference here is that you’re summoning things to a chess-like board of squares, meaning you can block off enemy attacks with careful positioning, or make use of weaker ranged units by putting them out of your enemies’ reach. You can corner the opposing God so that they have limited space, or fight for some goodies that spawn in the centre ground. It adds an extra dimension to the gurning arithmetic that goes on in your brain during these types of card games. Each turn has to be played in the ideal ordered, logical steps but also with an awareness of space.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/smitetacs3.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are only a few Gods to start, each bringing its own Pantheon to its deck. As well as a weak and basic attack, these Gods also have a special ability. For example, Zeus can spend a couple of mana (the magic dollars you spend to play the cards) to draw a fresh card from his deck. Odin can buff his summoned dirtbags with a similar mana tithe. The trade-off is that using an ability exhausts the God, so you can’t normally attack <em>and</em> use your special powers. It’s one or the other.</p>, <p>The important thing to know is that lesser gods – the kind you can spawn as units on the field – also have these secondary abilities. Aphrodite can put a shield on another unit and heal it. Bastet can summon three weak cats each with 1 attack and 1 health. Loki can teleport an enemy three tiles away and deal it 5 damage. This is an extra thing to keep in mind as you fight. It’s not always as simple as comparing red and green numbers.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/smitetacs2.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are a bunch of these lesser gods in each pantheon (about 7-9 in each) but only a couple are open to the beginner in the starter decks. To get new cards you earn ‘favour’ and spend it on new packs. These contain 5 random cards. But there’s also the obligatory free-to-play vom, which encourages you to spend real cash to get ‘runes’ that you can spend on packs. The shop full of runes is unsurprisingly tiered to make you spend more. 7 card packs would cost you 500 runes, for example. But the <a href="https://www.smitetactics.com/store/">“BUY BUY BUY” page</a> lists only 400 runes or 800 runes as a viable purchase, with no in-between option. It’s classic stuff from the big book of F2P monetary psychology – inventing a faux currency, randomising the results of a loot pack, implementing a slow grind – and there’s nothing here that other similar games don’t indulge in. But that doesn’t make it any less icky. Especially if you buy the founder’s pack and are already paying $20 to <i>test the game for them.</i></p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/smitetacs7.jpg"/></p>, <p>And here’s the kicker. You really are testing this game. Placeholder art is one thing, but bugs and a positively malnourished user interface mean that even a short and steady match will have its “gurr?” moments. I’ll give you an example: I was playing as Zeus, facing down a player wielding a sturdy Ra. I was on the ropes, almost certainly going to lose. But that’s okay, I thought, with my last action this turn I can just splurdge 2 mana and draw a new card.</p>, <p>“NotEnoughManaForAbility,” said a banner at the top of the screen.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/smitetacs8.jpg"/></p>, <p>I checked my mana. I had three.</p>, <p>I checked the cost of the ability. “Spend 2 mana to draw a card,” it read.</p>, <p>Hm.</p>, <p>I lost that match, and I probably still would have lost whether the game let me draw a new card or not. But it was an eye-rolling reminder that I was playing a game that didn’t always function correctly.</p>, <p>Other times there is no bug but the game has not explained itself in a reliable way. During another match, I used a ‘stun’ card on an enemy’s ranged minion. From everything I’d experienced thus far, this would stop an enemy minion from taking any action the next turn. I also poisoned her for good measure. That way, she would also die at the end of the next go. It was an expensive set of moves but, unless the enemy God had a purification spell (which removes status effects), the minion was certain to die.</p>, <p>I was very confused when she let off a shot and struck me for a nasty 4 damage on the next turn. Obviously, I have missed something here – but what? I looked at the battle log (a little menu to the left that shows previous cards played) but I couldn’t see anything that explained it. Can minions only suffer one status effect at a time? Was this minion immune to stunning? That can’t be it, I saw the little stars whizz around her head. Does ‘stun’ actually just mean a minion can’t move but can still attack? No, because, inspecting the card, it says that stun ‘exhausts’ a unit entirely. Unless ‘exhausts’ means something else? I still don’t know what happened here.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/smitetacs4.jpg"/></p>, <p>Of course, these moments of confusion were sometimes only a matter of me learning the vocabulary of the game, getting to know the exact effects of each brutish Ymir, or what ‘Pardon’ meant when a giant enemy Fury is storming down the middle of the board towards you (it means the unit can’t be counter-attacked when it strikes). At those moments when I’d misinterpreted something that ought to have been clear, I felt irritated – but only at myself.</p>, <p>There are many small differences between this and my usual stomping ground of Duelyst. Your deck is half the size for one thing, bringing only 20 cards to the battle grounds. This is because draw is much slower. You can’t replace a card once per turn, so there’s less ‘digging’ for a particular card to land the killing blow.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/smitetacs5.jpg"/></p>, <p>But this only makes the matches slower-paced and gives the victim of an opening hand of bad cards a sense that they’ve already lost. Sometimes I have gone two or three turns without even playing a card, simply because I couldn’t afford it in the early game. Normally, if this happened a lot I would consider re-making my deck – but this was with a starter deck, something that ought to be well-rounded. Duelyst’s solution of being able to shuffle a card back in and draw again once per turn dulls the pain of an unlucky draw. With its smaller deck and secondary abilities, I get the feeling that Smite Tactics wants to be a slower, more thoughtful game. But it only succeeds at being the former.</p>, <p>With card design, it simply felt like there was a lack of invention. And although each pantheon has its own tone, no god was radically different from another, no strategies seemed unique to any deck. Odin has some swarmy abilities, for example. One card lets him spawn two ranged archers at a time, another spawns two small soldier boys at a time. Then, he can unleash a cheap spell that does 1 damage at random for every friendly minion.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/smitetacs6.jpg"/></p>, <p>This is a better example of one God’s vibe but even here there is a fundamental design flaw. All those cards need to be played in succession to land the fullest, strongest blow. Spawn the creeps and wait until the next turn and you risk them all being killed by the time you get the chance to cast the cheap damage spell, nullifying it totally. But do what seems natural and correct – play all the cards one after the other – and you’ll find yourself with an empty hand and no way to draw up. This might be a interesting risk/reward mechanic for other players but to me the slow draw speed and low creature count feels like a stifling limitation on the game, a ball and chain that turns everything into a sluggish crawl toward an unsatisfying and non-creative KO.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/smitetacs9.jpg"/></p>, <p>There are other issues, like I said, mostly with the user interface. The matchmaking boots you back to a previous menu for a few seconds when it has found a match, leaving you wondering if it was successful or not. The campaigns promise to allow you to fight AI puzzles in exchange for rare cards, but this menu was totally empty when I clicked on it. Sometimes a match will end and claim you the victor, but there’s no indication if this was because the enemy conceded or disconnected or what. These are all problems that will likely be fixed but for now they make the whole experience feel a bit sloppy.</p>, <p>I feel like I haven’t seen enough of the cards to say for definite whether Smite Tactics has some clever plays and strange tricks embedded in its design. It may well have. But the glacial pace, old fashioned fantasy art (filled to the brim with gratuitous tits), sluggish grind and borked UI mean I can’t help but view it as a poor man’s Duelyst.

Halo Wars 2</a> [<a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/games/halo-wars-2">official site</a>] is undeniably a console RTS – a rare, exotic bird that looks a bit weird and could only have evolved on an island split off from the rest of the world. Removing it from its natural habitat and introducing it to the PC ecosystem, where its evolutionary niche isn’t quite so niche, might seem a little cruel and ill-conceived. But while it’s certainly not a perfect fit, it’s striking and, more often than not, quite a lot of fun. Here’s wot I think.</p>, <p><span id="more-430649"></span></p>, <p>It’s been a long time since Halo Wars first graced the Xbox 360, but it’s been longer still for the game’s protagonists, the stalwart crew of the Spirit of Fire. They’ve been asleep for decades, only to return to a galaxy that’s changed. A post-Halo 5 galaxy. As Ron Perlman likes to remind us, however, some things never change; whatever else has happened while the crew have been sleeping, the Halo Universe still loves a good war. And so it is that the long lost Spartans and Marines find themselves embroiled in yet another conflict, even before they’ve wiped the sleep out of their eyes.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/hwars1.jpg"/></p>, <p>Remember the Brutes? The big gorilla-like aliens who served the Covenant? Well, they’ve rebelled, sent the Covenant packing, and their leader Atriox has claimed the Halo-building Ark as his new home. One ship stands in the way of his plans, and that’s enough to kick the plot into gear, even if I’ve either forgotten what those plans were or they were never clearly expressed in the first place. </p>, <p>Halo Wars 2 spins a yarn that’s pretty typical of the main series – some high concept ideas made a little rote by a very simple narrative. For all the weird super weapons, nature reserves floating in the heavens and super-smart AIs, the campaign mostly just focuses on humans fighting evil aliens. Again. And then it ends awkwardly and abruptly to set up a sequel. </p>, <p>This three act war takes more than a few ideas from its FPS counterpart, with its exceptional Blur-created cutscenes – stunning works of CG art – and story-driven missions. Each of these 12 battles feels distinct, too. Not to the extent of, say, StarCraft 2, but there’s enough of a mix so that the campaign doesn’t outstay its welcome. Most missions take between 20-30 minutes to complete, so it’s a brief campaign, but it’s blessed with solid pacing and a good mix of objectives and scenarios.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/hwars2.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s also surprisingly welcoming to Halo newcomers. It really doesn’t matter if you haven’t been paying much attention to what has become a massive and rich universe, because the crew of the Spirit of Fire have been out of the loop for years. Between the crew itself getting up to speed and the unlockable snippets of lore, it’s easy to get a grip on what the hell an Ark is and why everyone’s so obsessed with the titular Halos. </p>, <p>Campaign highlights include fighting and even getting to control the ridiculously huge Scarab unit – one of two super units in the game – and giving orders to not one but three badass Spartans. The campaign is filled to the brim with thrilling, explosive moments, which almost makes up for some stinkers like holding an area for 30 minutes, which Creative Assembly seem to think is such a fun mission objective that they use it twice.</p>, <p>Let’s get back to the Spartans. Even though they appear as teeny, tiny warriors here, they are every bit as impressive as the likes of Master Chief. Every unit, from the vehicle-pounding Cyclops to the speedy and iconic Warthog, gets a special ability on top of its primary fire mode. The Warthog, for instance, revs up and slams into enemies with satisfying kinetic force. The Spartans are special, however. They get two equally fancy powers.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/hwars3.jpg"/></p>, <p>The first Spartan ability allows them to leap into the air and crush units when they nail their landing. This also lets them quickly jump off cliffs, surprising their foes below. Target a vehicle with that leap, though, and the ability changes. Instead of smashing into the vehicle, they hijack it. Every vehicle apart from the aforementioned super units is vulnerable to their superior hacking skills, allowing them to flit around the battlefield inside everything from the spry Wraiths to huge mechs bristling with rocket launchers. They feel every bit like the super soldiers the FPS makes them out to be. </p>, <p>While the unit selection is strong and their abilities often flashy, Halo Wars 2 never really seems to care how you use them. There are counter units, support units, myriad upgrades, but fights mostly just come down to who has the biggest blob of scrappers. I mean, you can try to play tactically, and you’ll probably need to – at least a little bit – when facing human opponents, but even then it’s more about army composition rather than being the smarter commander. </p>, <p>Controlling the Spartans, and every other aspect of Halo Wars 2’s vibrant and colourful battles, can feel a little off at times. Even when using a mouse and keyboard, it’s clear that concessions have been made for controllers. Units can be ordered to move, attack and use their special ability, but there’s little of the extra layer of control you might expect from a PC RTS. Your units constantly need to be micromanaged, there’s no patrol or guard options, and they’re cursed with poor pathfinding. The AI isn’t a serious threat, mind, and replacing units is a doddle, so if you do lose track of them, it’s not the end of the world.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/hwars4.jpg"/></p>, <p>These limitations aren’t all bad, however. Being able to relax on the sofa while playing an RTS using a controller is an enjoyable novelty, for one, but even if you’re playing Halo Wars 2 like a traditional RTS, the restrictions sometimes create interesting strategic wrinkles. </p>, <p>Base building definitely falls into this category. Instead of being able to place structures and defences wherever you please, maps are littered with predetermined base locations for HQs and mini-bases. Once you construct one, extra nodes appear around them, and that’s where you’ll plonk down your resource harvesting buildings, unit production facilities and your turrets. It seems horribly restrictive at first, but I’m now pretty sold on the idea. </p>, <p>If you need more energy or supplies – the game’s two resources, which are only generated by buildings because there are no resource nodes – you can’t just build a new generator or depot whenever or wherever you want. If you’ve already got one of each, chances are that you’ll need to destroy a building to make room for an extra one. Or you’ll need to explore, hopefully finding a node where you can set up a smaller base. This forces commanders to plan ahead and be willing to make the occasional sacrifice while also making build orders more reactive. It also encourages aggression and boldness. When you run out of space, you’re probably going to need to steal it from your opponent, destroying one of their bases and then building on its ashes.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/hwars5.jpg"/></p>, <p>Maps tend to be compact areas, full of winding paths that end in open battlefields. Units don’t move swiftly, especially in groups where their speed always matches the most sluggish unit, but battles are frenetic affairs where victories happen quickly. Despite their pace, there are plenty of opportunities for shifts in dominance and nasty surprises, largely thanks to powerful leader abilities. These nifty skills can be used to heal groups of units, drop down turrets or extra squads like ODST troops, or carpet bomb an entire area. Smart use of these game-changers can decide the outcome of a fight, but they have long cooldowns, so you’ve got to pick your moments.</p>, <p>While Halo Wars 2 has its fair share of multiplayer modes, often influenced by the FPS games, the standout is undoubtedly Blitz. It subtracts buildings and unit construction for pacy firefights over a trio of capture points, with troops and abilities being played via cards. It’s a deck-building game, then, with each faction and commander getting unique cards, as well as a few neutral ones. You need to fight over energy pods that fall from the heavens before spending that energy on new units and powers, so it’s not just a race to get to the capture points, but also battle over fleeting resources. </p>, <p>In the other modes, there’s little beyond aesthetics to make armies feel distinct, but in Blitz there are enough unique cards to make some pretty diverse loadouts. And of course there’s the randomisation factor, as you’re never quite know what your hand is going to be. There’s usually a decent mix of powers and units, though, and I’ve never been in a position where I didn’t have anything worth playing. It helps that you can burn a card – for a cost – and immediately get a replacement. Cards costs are also generally low enough that you can field a beefy force with powerful units after only a short time, letting you get right into the thick of things and enjoy the type of scraps that you’d have to wait much longer for elsewhere.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/hwars6.jpg"/></p>, <p>Blitz is also the one place in Halo Wars where it feels like you’re being rewarded for being a clever, sneaky bastard. Because I’d played through the whole campaign before jumping into Blitz, I’d gotten used to just stomping around maps with one giant army, but that doesn’t really work here. It’s also not a good idea to spread your forces out; you’ve got to stay mobile. </p>, <p>Recently, I’ve been saving up my energy and leaving a single, expendable unit on the far side of a point. When the enemy storms it, I drop some mines – if I have them – and then summon what is essentially a brand new army. Maintaining line of sight of the capture points turns out to be even more important than keeping them defended.</p>, <p>Halo Wars 2 is simultaneously conservative and inventive. It’s definitely trying to evoke traditional RTS games – which is not entirely a bad thing given the recent dearth of them – especially when it comes to the campaign, but elements like base construction and Blitz mode make it stand out enough that it doesn’t feel like you’re just going through the motions for the hundredth time. A clumsy UI and weird, sometimes fixed, keybindings and controls reveal its console heritage, but there are a surprising number of benefits to that side of the design. Some of the places where the formula has been redesigned in order to appeal to the Xbox One crowd, and to fit a controller, are the points where Halo Wars 2 finds an identity of its own.

With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/Aer/">Aer</a> still somehow not out yet, I needs me some more flying about a pretty place games. Spotting Copoka [<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/582620/">Steam page</a>] in the waterfall of Steam releases I wondered if it might keep me going. Not really, no. Here’s wot I think:<span id="more-430081"></span></p>, <p>Copoka ends up as one of those nice ideas that just doesn’t quite come together. I’ve argued before that there need to be far more games about flying around as a bird, so it would be churlish for me to entirely dismiss this. The problem is, there are too many problems, from the bugginess of the game, the lack of proper satisfaction with the flight controls, and a narrative concept that doesn’t hold together.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/copo2.jpg"/></p>, <p>On some levels I want to be more generous – this is a small indie game costing less than a pint of warm ale, and in many ways very pleasant. But on another I’m really annoyed by how it has described itself:</p>, <p>“Copoka is an open-world exploratory indie game where you play as a bird flying around a city looking for twigs to build your nest.”</p>, <p>Now that’s game I wanted to play. That is not a description of Copoka. It is with some bitter irony that I notice the developers are called “Inaccurate Interactive”.</p>, <p>This is in fact a very small enclosed city, which you can see all of from your starting point in the middle, with no meaningful notion of exploration at all. There’s nothing hidden, nothing revealed by looking over there, no openness in any understanding of the term. It feels like what might be the first level of a larger game, instead used four times in a row as the only level of a very small game. Again, small indie game – but bad description.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/copo3.jpg"/></p>, <p>But take that limited (although sprawling, and very lovingly detailed) city and then let me play as a bird seeking out sticks and twigs to build a nest! That sounds adorable and splendid. But it’s not that either. It’s in fact a game about flying toward building-sized sparkling lights around the city and picking up four lots of four shiny objects, and carrying them back to your already-built nest. Yes, one of these four madly twinkling objects in each round is a twig, but no, that’s not what was described. Along the way there are 12 bonus feathers to fly into, which speed you up (barely noticeably), but I found ten of these without trying, and an eleventh after a quick look.</p>, <p>The real point to it all is to overhear conversations between denizens of the city as you float about. It seems there’s a fascistic leader in place in what appears to perhaps be a banana republic, with a burgeoning rebellion planning to rise up. Each time you collect four items the story advances forward (with no noticeable change beyond the conversations taking place), so you can listen in again by flying near clouds of white feathers. But fly away from them and they stop or fade out, which is utterly infuriating since there’s nothing to actually <em>do</em> during these unanimated chats. You just have to sit your bird there, being bored for a bit.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/copo5.jpg"/></p>, <p>The characters in the world are a lovely design, and the whole place is very pretty. It has some great music, and it plays in dynamically dependent upon where you’re flying in the city. But it’s glitchy as all hell, flight not letting you satisfactorily swoop and swish as you might like, with your bird unable to take off from far too many places it can land, and clearly there is such a high expectation that you’ll get stuck clipped into the world that it monitors for it and respawns you after a few seconds. But I think more problematic is the story, an attempt to, I dunno – discuss? – regime change and totalitarianism, but I guess the polite word to describe it is “sophomoric”. The more accurate might be “bad”. In the end, it felt to me more of a piece of apologism for a dictatorship! I think that might be more to do with being badly handled than deliberate political intent. But still.</p>, <p>Again, so much of this criticism really wouldn’t feel relevant if the game’s <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/582620/">own storefront</a> (if it has its own website, I cannot find it) didn’t describe something totally other than what’s being sold. This is not an open world game, there’s absolutely no exploring, and you don’t gather twigs to build a nest.

There’s a scene in the History Channel’s Vikings where the protagonist, Ragnar Lothbruk, says he is “bloodsick” after a hard fought campaign. He’s maudlin, weary of everything. It’s as if he is coming down from a dark age combat high. Well, that’s sort of how For Honor leaves me feeling after a battle. Even if my team won, I’m frustrated and irritable at all the small deaths. That attack from behind by three other players. That shonky, crowded melee amid the NPC pawns. Those dozen cuts from a Samurai blade that I <i>could have sworn</i> I was blocking. All of it working together to leave me weary, sighing and bloodsick.<br/>
<span id="more-429937"></span></p>, <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/for-honor/">For Honor</a> is Ubisoft’s ludicrous love song to the idea behind Deadliest Warrior. What if all these infamous fighters through history were to meet and fight it out? Vikings, Knights and Samurai clash swords, axes and katanas in a never-ending war. There’s a story mode behind it all, which puts a manipulative war God, Appolyon, at the centre of things, conspiring to make the three groups fight their infinite fight. This single-player (or co-op) mode has its strengths. It’s a good way of learning each character’s moves, for example, and completing the story gets you a good amount of steel, the game’s currency, which you can spend in multiplayer to unlock new classes of character or gamble for better gear in grubby loot crates.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor2.jpg"/></p>, <p>But mission by mission it’s not much more than a conglomeration of recycled multiplayer levels with set pieces and terrible dialogue that you’ll recognise from hundreds of action movies. Toward the end, one of the characters confronts Appolyon, who has been stirring up trouble like an armoured Trickster since the start. “You!” the character gasps, “You <i>want</i> war!?” I exploded into laughter. Yes, you dense fugitive. We have known that since the opening cinematic. We have known that since the <i>trailer.</i></p>, <p><img alt="You're an idiot, you are." src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor3.jpg"/></p>, <p>While the story mode is not much but a hackneyed tapestry sewn together from Ubisoft’s big box of levels, the real gristle to chew on was always going to be the multiplayer fights. The premise might be Vikings v Samurai v Knights but that’s not how the fights actually work. It’s red versus blue and you can mix and match, fight as any kind of warrior. So in the game’s 2v2 brawl mode you might have one team featuring a ninja-like Orochi and a blonde Raider, throwing down with a knightly Warden and a spear-wielding Valkyrie. The eternal war of three is only really for show (and for the ‘war map’ – which I’ll talk about later).</p>, <p>After moshing about in the open beta, I stormed into the full game confident in my ability to throw tin men off bridges. A lot of genres have been fused together here to create sportsmanlike battles full of angry men and women going back and forth and stabbing each other in the head. In game modes like Dominion there’s even a little bit of MOBA influence if you squint. Fragile creeps in the form of lowly soldiers constantly flood down the “middle” of the battlefield, and you have to help them out by clearing the way of enemy creep-soldiers. Unlike the other two control points, this is the only way to take the centre of the map. You have to pitch in with the plebs, which leads to all sorts of moshpit like fights with player-controlled enemies, as each of you try to find space among the throng to get a sense of your surroundings and lunge at each other.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor4.jpg"/></p>, <p>In this mode, you need to get 1000 points and the enemy will “break”, at which point you need to kill them all and wipe them out, since they can’t respawn while they’re breaking. But if the enemy can hold out, kill your team and regain some ground and points, they will “rally” allowing respawns again and giving them the chance to break the other team in a counter-attack. This can lead to close games as warriors rush around the field reviving their dead mates (this doesn’t count as a respawn) and coming back from the brink of defeat. To ensure the dead remain dead and “unreviveable”, you can kick or push players off ledges, where their body can’t be reached, or you can perform an “execution” as your final blow against a flagging player. They can’t bring you back to life without a head, mate. Sort yourself out.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor5.jpg"/></p>, <p>Much of the appeal comes down to the fights themselves. One-on-one bouts can be tense, exciting battles. You have to be aware of your foe’s attacking direction (presented as little white arrows) and match that direction while guarding to block the incoming hit, while also striking out in an effort to get past their own guard. This is the basic principle of the fighting, however, there’s much more going on underneath. Sometimes <i>too much more</i>. You can also grab opponents, throw them, parry attacks and perform heavier and slower attacks. It doesn’t really end there. Depending on the type of warrior you’ve brought into the fray you can also:</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor6.jpg"/></p>, <p>Because of the variety of tactics and movesets, defeating even one player requires agility, timing and a vicious and permanent awareness of the nearest unfenced ledge. It’s a rough, adrenal affair. But then you find yourself up against two people. Three people. The entire enemy team. At this point you’re lean, high-grade mincemeat. Taking on more than a single person alone is folly. And that’s before you consider any of the character’s perks that are unlocked as the battle goes on. Some of these let you plant down a life-giving aura for other players. Some let you call in a volley of arrows on enemies, or throw flasks full of fire, or “mark an enemy for death” and reduce their defence.</p>, <p>I learned how to fight dirty when I lived with the <a href="http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Rat+King+Covenant">Rat King Covenant</a>, however. So I love the use of your environment to get kills or even just to make your opponent wary of approaching you. Throwing people into pits, moats, off cliffs, castle walls, perilous bridges. Booting them into a wall of spikes or headbutting them straight into a fire. It summons a good, bloodlusty feeling. It makes you feel like Rollo Lothbruk, you know, before he went all <i>French</i>.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor1.jpg"/></p>, <p>But there are also plenty of players to whom the whole system of blocking, countering, feinting and slashing comes freakishly naturally. During one gore-soaked Dominion match, I had repeated face-offs with one Knight who was consistently swinging a mace around as he jealously guarded a control point the entire match. I tried everything – grabs, counter-attacks, stunning blows, dodging strikes. Every time it was a futile effort. Six times I had my head crushed by that mace during our vicious rivalry. Six times. It was like having a fight with a living quicktime event.</p>, <p>There’s usually at least one person like this in every match. Normally, a jerkish Samurai Orochi. These dual-wielding characters don’t have a default stance (same goes for the Knight’s Assassin and the Viking’s Berserker), so the direction of their incoming attack doesn’t appear until the last second, meaning you have to be quicker in response when guarding. They are fast, vicious monsters who can dart and dodge blows while delivering their own small cuts at the same time. You can play as giant, tanky characters and still succumb to the speed of these stab-happy rats.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor8.jpg"/></p>, <p>The trade-off is that they are difficult to learn and master, like other classes of fighter. Spear-wielding Valkyries make me quake with fear, because they have a move that can sweep you up by the heels if executed properly, and they are fond of bashing you with their shield. The most rotund of the Knights, the Lawbringer, has a pinning charge that stabs you in the gonads, which can then be followed up with unblockable attacks that you’ll need to dodge, not block. But if you’re like me, the instinct to raise your shield will always take over and you’ll know before the strike hits, by the appearance of small firey symbol, that you are soundly dead.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor9.jpg"/></p>, <p>But again, these classes are hard to learn well. They can still fall to the much more manageable Raider. I use this hearty woman to whap people on the bonce and stun them. In this state their screen goes “grrrhb?” and they can’t tell which direction the next strike is coming from. In their panic, I grab them and toss them off a rampart.</p>, <p>So, the fighting is quite good. But there are issues. The popular Dominion mode is both the most fun and the most annoying. Here, death comes by the gankful. A lonely player is a delicious lamb for a pair or a trio. And if you are being spammed with attacks from multiple directions, there’s normally no way out of it. You’re supposed to be able to roll out of a fight by double-tapping A. But firstly, the roll never rolls you that far. Secondly, any blow while “unlocked” from enemies interrupts your movement completely. Running is only an option if there’s already distance between you and your predator.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor10.jpg"/></p>, <p>You could play the 1v1 duels exclusively, or you can just accept this pack mentality to be part of the game, train yourself to recognise the signs of a fight worth fighting. If I’m on my todd and I see three enemies, for instance, I tend to turn around and “nope” my way out of there lickety-split. If I see one guy, I’ll charge toward him and look for the nearest environmental hazard. But there’s no avoiding the gank sometimes. Players popping out of seemingly nowhere, AI bots becoming human at a moment’s notice, running around a corner to find the whole enemy team descending on you like a pack of rabid honey badgers. All these deaths and more will come to you in time, my sweet child.</p>, <p>The problem, I think, is that there is far too much going on in any one fight. Say you run up to point C and, oh look, it’s a Warden with death in his eyes. That’s okay, let’s just keep your eyesight trained on his guard stance. Left, right… high red! Parry! Left, high… heavy left swing! Dodge! Phew, this guy is really dancing that’s for sure.</p>, <p>But as you’re doing all this you also need to be keeping an eye on those ledges nearby. There’s three drops into sweet nothing to keep track of here, and a forth onto a lower level, where he might throw you and jump down with a killing leap (or where you might be thinking to do the same) and these are – Left red! Block! Right red, parry! – these are things to be aware of.</p>, <p>So your eyes are going everywhere at this stage, when you suddenly, instinctively remember to glance at your radar. There are two orange blips coming up behind you. “GG, Warden.” You mutter as the knives come down, “GG.”</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor11.jpg"/></p>, <p>In other words, For Honor demands an often-exhausting amount of spatial awareness, abstract awareness of enemies, and the twitch-like instincts of the fight itself. It’s like trying to play three Batman Arkham games at once. Then, at a critical moment, the screen is covered with garbage.</p>, <p>I’m talking about the game’s UI here, which is as intrusive and irritating as any Ubi game can be expected to be. Even the menus outside a fight are busy, garbled boxes. On the multiplayer menu there’s a big war map which shows the territories owned and fought over by each faction. As you win matches you can dispatch “war assets” into these territories on behalf of the faction you’ve allied yourself to. I pledged myself to the Vikings at the start of the game, so a big axe comes down and stabs the map whenever I send my war assets somewhere. Take that, map! Every few hours the map changes, depending on how folks have been allocating their warboys.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor12.jpg"/></p>, <p>But what any of this even means, I couldn’t tell you. At the end of a season, we’re told, there’ll be rewards for everyone who participated, according to your faction’s score. But fight-by-fight, this map is just a convoluted distraction. It helps to think of it like the map in Planetside 2, except you can’t explore a single inch of it and it has no real significance, since all the battles already take place on a preset list of cycling levels entirely unrelated to the larger world. An early video says if an area falls into enemy hands “you will see many changes”. But they only mean that some round shields on an insignificant wall will become square banners on an insignificant wall. There’s no real geography to any of it, no real war. Just a playlist of battles and a funny-looking map slowly being painted a Viking red (<i>Valhallllaaaaaaaaaa!</i>).</p>, <p>But nothing demonstrates the game’s overbearing UI like when a match goes to sudden death. Here, darkness starts to intrude at the edge of your screen, the left and right fills up with names and profile pictures so that you can see who’s dead and who’s not. All this at the expense of seeing, you know, <i>the actual battlefield</i>.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor13.jpg"/></p>, <p>It is a frustrating and totally unnecessary obfuscation of your view. Your fighting attention is already busy enough, filled to breaking point with radar, player enemies, NPC hordes, and environmental obstacles. I do not need giant skulls appearing in my peripheral vision, along with more flashing words right in the centre of my sight. UI designers, please stop what you are doing. Please, stop.</p>, <p>There are other irritations, unrelated to stabbing men in the neck. Matchmaking is unreliable and often garnished with lengthy wait times. When a match ends players often leave, and the game doesn’t know how to look for new ones, even if there’s four people willing to stay, so it just kicks you all out at the end of a timer. I’ve seen all manner of error messages saying that a match I’ve tried to join is full, or that there’s a simple “network error”, both of which kick me out of matchmaking and back to the menus, rather than simply lining me up for a new match automatically. Network issues also mean you sometimes swing to stab an opponent for a cheap cut of human meat, only for the game to freeze and this to appear.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor14.jpg"/></p>, <p>It’s not an ideal launch. Mostly though, the busy-ness of the fighting is why, despite enjoying the charge of my warring Raider and being a dastardly manipulator of gravity, I tend to come away from the battles surly and tired. But also, the over-reliance on ganking as a genuine and expected tactic simply makes losing horrendously un-fun. They definitely called it For Honor as a joke, because I have rarely yelled “oh <i>fuck off</i>” at a death screen with such disdain for my opponents. “This game is going to give me a heart attack,” said one player to the rest of our team. We had just <i>won</i> a match.</p>, <p><img alt="" src="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/17/feb/wit_forhonor15.jpg"/></p>, <p>Overall, I don’t know exactly how I feel about For Honor. It sometimes feels like a Ubisoft hired a bunch of scientists in white coats to observe Dark Souls PvP from behind reinforced perspex and experiment on it with Dota DNA in a mad attempt to recreate a tame monster in a safe environment for their own nefarious ends (profit). What they’ve made is an interesting chimera, something that is both more accessible but sometimes just as unforgiving. I expect that to be able to enjoy it more, I’d need even more time to practice, more time to learn the ins and outs of all the characters, to become better at reading its clustered mess of a screen, to build up that thumb-cracking muscle memory to a point where I too can crush a man’s head with a mace six times in a row.</p>, <p>But I don’t know if I can face that. Because right now I just feel bloodsick.

Urban Trial Freestyle 2</em> challenges you to master a multitude of courses in either stunt mode or time attack. Tracks are treacherous with a variety of jumps, obstacles, and barely noticeable bumps that aim to trip you up. It took me a while to really get into the groove of everything. The key to doing well was not only track memory, but my ability to adjust on the fly. Speeding through a track isn’t necessarily the best way forward as I discovered it was much more important to make sure my bike was well balanced on the ground, going into a jump or coming in for a landing. </span></p>, <p><span>In stunt mode, there are a few pre-determined spots where you’ll need to complete the required “stunt.” I put that in quotes because three of the four “stunts” are not stunts at all. You either jump high, jump far, jump a certain distance, or do a flip. At first, I found the scoring for these tricks to be wildly inconsistent but I eventually learned the quirks of the system. For instance, when doing a flip I found that nailing a perfect 360 wasn’t nearly as well received as slightly going over. </span></p>, <p><span>Tracks aren’t necessarily built to make performing these “stunts” easy. In fact, many of them seemed to be actively working against me and nailing a four or five-star run required multiple attempts. Branching pathways made replaying the tracks enjoyable, but the poor placement of checkpoints hurt the experience. They almost feel like they’re inserted at random and several tracks could be greatly improved with some checkpoint adjustments. One I remember had a series of difficult sections with a small break in between the two most difficult jumps. Clearing this part of the track took roughly 20 tries, a number that could have been cut in half had the checkpoint been moved from the end of this section to the middle. I know that sounds like a you-need-to-get-gud complaint, but many other tracks where I didn’t face any troublesome jumps also had checkpoints that made little sense in their location.</span></p>, <p><span><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6aVONX1io8w" width="640"></iframe></span></p>, <p><span>I don’t think I’ve ever given much thought to a game’s menus in any of my previous reviews, but I need to take a moment to tell you how awful they are here. Tracks are grouped together in several different locations, such as highways and suburbs. When you select a location, you can choose the track you want to play, but after you are done with it, you can either go to the next track in the group or exit back out and repeat the selection process. The rest of the menus look straight out of the '90s and feel like a first draft. </span></p>, <p><span>Nowhere is the poor menu system more evident than in the track builder. You can build and upload your own uniquely designed tracks as well as download those designed by others. The options are extensive for building your ultimate track, but there’s no smart or simple way to navigate its available elements. When placing pieces on your track, you can’t easily snap them together to make an easier ride. Creating a quality track took a lot, a lot, of trial and error as I had to learn the jump angles possible from each individual jump. Having more options would have kept me in the mode for longer, or even just the option to move where the finish line is. </span></p>, <p><span>As for unlockables, there is new gear you can purchase - all of which is just as ugly as the rest of the game - as well as upgrades for your bikes. There are four bikes to unlock that each handle in their own unique way and upgrades you can purchase for those bikes. </span></p>, <p><span>I’m sure there is a demographic out there that <em>Urban Trial Freestyle 2</em> will appeal to, but it is clear to me now that I am not a part of that key demo. While I can appreciate what they were going for here and I found myself really getting into the challenge, any feeling of joy I experience doesn’t last for long when I’m faced with so many bewildering design choices.</span></p>, <p><sub><span>[</span><span>This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]</span></sub></p>, <p class="center"><b>Urban Trial Freestyle 2</b> reviewed by CJ Andriessen</p>, <p>Slightly above average or simply inoffensive.

Some stick with me, like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-total-war-warhammer-359936.phtml" target="_blank">Total War: Warhammer</a></em>. Others fall by the wayside and are forgotten like <em>Fire Warrior</em>.</p>, <p>But the <i>Dawn of War </i>series has been one of the most consistent sub-franchises of all.

But seeing as the developers even stated in the past it is "inspired" by them, you're going to see some similarities.</p>, <p>Sure there's a core to destroy now in multiplayer matches, but first and foremost, the modus operandi is that of an RTS. There's base building, point capturing, and plenty of micromanaging and control group creation. It's more like the first <em>Dawn of War</em> really, with a few streamlined concepts like enhanced heroes (elites) and stealth brush thrown in -- things that have been done in plenty of RTS games before it, from <em>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</em>'s Tanya and beyond. Elites need to be paid for with elite points, which you speed up by capturing points and building generators on top of said points, which you'll need to constantly defend. There's walkers as well, but their existence feels somewhat cheapened by elites (they can share the same category), as they have less abilities to work with and mechanically provide a lot of the same support.</p>, <p>That's forgivable though as each and every elite is formidable, yet sports few enough skill shots to make them impactful without providing an overwhelming presence like MOBA heroes. It's a delicate balance, but I like having elites, especially some of the more lore-heavy ones, in tandem with the base building system. With that in mind, the lack of variable win conditions in multiplayer (it's always "blow up the core") is something I'd love to see altered in a patch.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N_ZgyNoHtjw" width="560"></iframe></p>, <p>Mechanics like mass recalling, interconnected teleporation webways, and timed core invulnerability make for some cool comebacks, but ultimately they just filter back into the idea of destroying the core instead of tactically cutting off each building one by one (which you can still do, but if you're in their territory, you may as well go for the win). I tested out some AI matches in addition to multiplayer pre-launch, across the 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 modes. Eight maps is <em>just</em> enough to get me by, but after enough time has passed I can see myself wanting more.</p>, <p>Taking a closer look at the armies -- Marines, Eldar, and Orks -- Relic is basically riffing off of the launch choices from <em>Dawn of War II</em>, minus the Tyranids. Stylistically they're very different, and if you were going to go with three choices, these are probably the ones you want. As per the actual lore Marines are basically 'roided-up assholes that rely on functional tech, Orks operate with horde-like mentality with shoddy weaponry, and the Eldar are prim and proper mystics.</p>, <p>Mechanical differences range from the subtle (a few elites share the same abilities with only slight nuances) to drastic (Orks need to build towers to upgrade their army, and Eldar can warp buildings around at will). All three armies are wonderfully animated, which is a feat given the enhanced unit count. It's always a treat to see the detail that goes into something as basic as summoning grunts, though I do wish you could zoom in a bit more.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="1080" src="https://www.destructoid.com//ul/430945-/Dawn%202-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p>Proper cover is gone (it's relegated to a shield buff in certain locations now, though the Eldar can call upon their own version of it), but there's still plenty of micro opportunities for each and every unit. You can toggle stances for melee and ranged attacks, use unique abilities like grenades or jump jets, queue up defensive or hold formations, and issue sequential commands for individual units -- typical RTS staples. Every squad is also explained with a helpful series of tooltips, so even if you don't partake in the <em>40K</em> universe you can tell the difference between a heavy bolter and a lascannon. The unit build queue is also easy to read, as is creating multiple control groups. <em>Dawn of War III</em> is more accessible than past entries, but it doesn't sacrifice its integrity to get there.</p>, <p>Multiplayer isn't the only thing on offer, as there's still a campaign mode that sprawls across the three aforementioned factions. You'll jump from mission to mission as it follows the core narrative, spurred by the Eldar's obsession with the Spear of Khaine, a "divine" weapon. Some are elite-centric and that's fine (I liked the Nova missions in <em>StarCraft II</em> for the same reason), but because of that laser focus, you could argue that it takes multiple levels until it really ramps up into something exciting.</p>, <p>When it does get good, it can also get frustrating. Some later missions feel cheap in the sense that the CPU is kind of just throwing insurmountable odds your way without the level of tactical depth you'd expect from an RTS campaign. It's also worth noting that when playing through the story mode I experienced some light glitches -- things like units moving through walls even though they lacked an ability like jump jets -- but nothing game-breaking or critical like crashes.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="1080" src="https://www.destructoid.com//ul/430945-/Dawn%203-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p>As far as long term goals go, playing just about any mode will earn you skulls to unlock more elites, which is all part of the rat race. It rubs me the wrong way that some of the more iconic characters are gated behind skulls, as are some individual abilities, but these gates never felt like they were outright ruining the game or even slowing the pace of any individual match since their base kits are well designed. As is the case with any <em>Warhammer</em> strategy fantasy there's always more races and factions on my wishlist, but the deep faction/army painter is a good concession for now.</p>, <p><em>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III</em> takes a few steps back in time to make one step forward. It hearkens back to a lot of older design choices from the first game, and attempts to build upon other RTS conventions in the process. Not everything works (especially the strict adherence to the core conceit), but it's still very much both a <em>Warhammer</em> and a <em>Dawn of War</em> joint.

As the obligatory remake of the bunch, Excess is a re-imagining of <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>'s Rust -- you know, that oil yard map. You remember, right? That one in the desert? No? Same. Every map has its fans, but I'm struggling to think of why anyone would pine for Rust's return.</p>, <p>Excess is a marked improvement with its snazzy metropolis theme, but that idea has been done so many times in multiple "far future" lines that it's not exactly novel (I wonder how people will take to the upcoming game, which returns to the series' roots). I do enjoy its open setup and the signature attention to detail, but it's not a particularly memorable part of the rotation. It's like a junkier wing of Turista (another map in the same DLC).</p>, <p><img border="0" height="720" src="../ul/431736-/Scrap-noscale.jpg" width="1280"/></p>, <p>Every <em>Call of Duty</em> map developer seems to be contractually obligated to occasionally provide a dull entry so the rest of the add-ons seem exciting by comparison. Scrap takes the bullet this time.</p>, <p>While there's plenty of opportunities for choke-points and interesting objective play, the "moon junkyard" motif really isn't doing it for me. It kind of exposes the limits of the space concept for <em>Infinite Warfare</em> in general -- while the team could have gone really out there and given us something alien (DLC is the perfect opportunity to be weird), or something new, we return to the moon.</p>, <p>There's one cool mechanic that involves jumping up onto a magnetic piece of machinery to invert your avatar, but it's not very practical and is limited to a few locations.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="720" src="../ul/431736-/Turista-noscale.jpg" width="1280"/></p>, <p>Turista is a little more rock and roll. It's a high-tech resort that's housed inside of an alien creature's skeleton, which is basically as metal as it gets in a sci-fi <em>Call of Duty</em>. A looming <em>Halo</em>-esque bone setpiece towers above you as you play and adds a good amount of atmosphere, and the (not obvious) three-lane setup ensures that it's easy to acclimate to on any playlist.</p>, <p>It's a beautiful level that pushes the engine and the design limitations that many of <em>Infinite Warfare</em>'s base maps suffer from.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="720" src="../ul/431736-/Archive-noscale.jpg" width="1280"/></p>, <p>Archive does enough to fit in as a premium map, with a distinct focus on indoor combat. The whole art gallery gimmick doesn't go nearly far enough (half a shark body coming out of the ground is funny for a moment, yet you cannot, I repeat <em>cannot</em> throw grenades into its mouth!), but it's bright and full of life, which beats out a lot of other maps. As well as it plays, I hope actual far future art is a little more punchy than this reality.</p>, <p>It can't be understated how much effort was put into the gallery though -- the Andy Warhol cat pictures series is a nice touch, and I can't believe you can read each individual placard (we've come a long way when it comes to FPS map aesthetics).</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JeiLqaPoExc" width="853"></iframe></p>, <p>Of course all roads lead to zombies, and most of you are probably picking up <em>Continuum</em> for its main course, Shaolin Shuffle. The comedic stylings of Kevin Smith (which, as polarizing as Smith is, fit well in the last DLC) have been subbed out for veteran actress Pam Grier, who is a pretty good get even if she's underutilized. I have a massive sweet spot for the disco era, and the Netflix show <em>Get Down</em> has allowed me to indulge in that fix, but I could always use more. This mostly delivers by taking some risks, even if they don't all pay off.</p>, <p>There are so many absurd and unique ideas in this DLC that really make the case for a standalone zombie game. Four individual kung-fu combat styles (and great-feeling weapons like swords) that embolden the typically weak melee system are the highlight, as is the disco dance floor, punk mosh pit trap, and a mutated former CEO rat king. They don't go too far out there mind, as most of the fluff like roller zombies and era-appropriate attire are things you'd expect to see.</p>, <p>The setting also unfortunately does not match the ferocity of its Tiger Style. A run down New York City, no matter the era, has been done to death -- and nothing here elevates it above the rest of those renditions. I'm still really digging the <em>Scooby-Doo</em>-ass cartoon cutscenes, and this subseries of zombies has so much heart, perhaps more than any other facet of any <em>Call of Duty</em> game before it. You have to give it to Infinity Ward's zombie team (and the celebrity cast) for sticking it out this long. I'm glad that these folks didn't meet the same "one and done" fate that Jeff Goldblum and company did in <em>Black Ops III</em>'s short-lived Shadows of Evil.</p>, <p><em>Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare: Continuum</em> is an uneven but above-average pack. It pales in comparison to <em>Sabotage</em>, but hasn't dragged down the season pass as a whole in any meaningful way. I'm anxious to see what the next two offerings can bring to the table, while we wait to hear more about <a href="../rumor-images-showing-call-of-duty-wwii-surface-427231.phtml" target="_blank">Sledgehammer's next project</a>.</p>, <p><span><sub>[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]</sub></span></p>, <p class="center"><b>Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare: Continuum</b> reviewed by Chris Carter</p>, <p>Slightly above average or simply inoffensive.

No matter the title, the developer knows what to do to absolutely charm me right off my feet. Whether I’m inhaling a Waddle-Dee, doing battle with a hippie, or figuring out the object hidden inside a block, HAL titles are able to produce that dumb, goofy, don’t-care-how-unattractive-it-is smile in ways no other games can, and <em>Bye-Bye BoxBoy!</em> is no different.</span></p>, <p></p>, 

If you’ve played <em>BoxBoy!</em> or <em><a href="../review-boxboxboy--372754.phtml">BoxBoxBoy!</a>,</em> congratulations, you already know the basics to <em>Bye-Bye BoxBoy!</em> Nothing has changed with the basic formula. You’re still controlling Qbby, a jubilant box with legs, to generate a single string of boxes that help him make his way through the three or four puzzles each level holds. These boxes can act as platforms to guide him safely over spikes or death pits, shields against electricity, or help Qbby reach places his stubby little jump can’t.</span></p>, <p><span>So long as you remember which button does what, you’ll have no problem mastering <em>Bye-Bye BoxBoy!</em>’s mechanics. I had played through the original game just before downloading this, so it was all second nature to me. While the opening set of puzzles didn’t do anything I hadn’t already seen in <em>BoxBoy!</em>, new hazards like water and wind mix things up, forcing me to pause, think, and create some eclectic chains of boxes in order to proceed. </span></p>, <p><span>Those puzzles were entertaining, but what really got me into the game was the Qbabies. Each of the first three planets house one of these little box kids in dire need of a good rescuing. Qbby saves them in a series of escort mission levels that, like every other level in the game, are short, sweet, and simple to grasp. As he proceeds, the Qbaby will either follow directly behind or be separated below him, requiring Qbby to drop down the appropriate box shape for them to proceed.</span></p>, <p><span><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P60cMyXxlDE?ecver=1" width="640"></iframe></span></p>, <p><span>Once the Qbabies are safe and sound, they grant new abilities. These skills, which allow Qbby to create boxes that rocket upward, blow up parts of the map, warp him past obstacles, and make a chain he can snake around the course, are fun to experiment with and really elevate the game. It just sucks the use of these power-ups is extremely limited, only accessible in a handful of puzzles. They never overstay their welcome, but I also don’t believe I saw the full potential for any of them in their brief appearance. As was my experience with <em>BoxBoy!</em>, <em>Bye-Bye BoxBoy!</em> is very easy and I was never really challenged until accessing the bonus worlds. Even collecting all of the optional crowns in each level, something you must do before you generate a certain number of boxes, was a cinch. </span></p>, <p><span>Outside of the journey, you can use earned coins to purchase new costumes, music, challenges, and comics, the last of which I found to be downright adorable. If you own either of the previous games, some of the costumes collected in those will transfer over including the incredibly useful bunny ears. You can also use <em>Kirby</em> series amiibo, or Kirby characters from the <em>Smash</em> line, to unlock cool-looking color costumes modeled after the pink puff and friends. The amiibo screen also has a slot for the Qbby figure which I hope is an indication that we’ll be seeing it here in the west and not simply something they forgot to remove in translation. </span></p>, <p><span><em>Bye-Bye BoxBoy!</em> is being billed as the last of the <em>BoxBoy!</em> trilogy and if this is where things truly end I think that’s for the better. Qbby is great and this monochrome world is wonderful, but I feel as though its basic puzzle formula is on the cusp of getting stale. If we do see more of this boxed boy, I hope his next adventure is something more substantial.</span></p>, <p><sub><span>[</span><span>This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]</span></sub></p>, <p class="center"><b>Bye-Bye BoxBoy!</b> reviewed by CJ Andriessen</p>, <p>A solid game that definitely has an audience.

No, I'm not talking about your grandma, but the protagonist of <em>Flinthook</em>, a game that had me 'hooked' from the start.</p>, <p>Sorry. I had to.

Flinthook </em>(PC <strong>[reviewed]</strong>, PS4, Xbox One)<br/>Developer: Tribute Games<br/>Publisher: <strong>Tribute Games</strong><br/>Released: April 18, 2017<br/>MSRP: $14.99</strong></p>, <p>On paper, <em>Flinthook</em> sounds like a formula that has been done to death (at least on Steam): a rogue-lite platformer with pixelated graphics and randomly generated maps. However, execution is everything, and Tribute Games has mostly nailed it from the wonderful intro laced with one of the most exciting chiptunes I've heard, to the long and difficult final bounty. </p>, <p>So check it: you're Mister Flinthook, a ghost that possesses a humanoid form which dawns an anchor that is used as a grappling hook. You're also a space pirate, which makes sense as each map is a different ship you board by blasting through on the giant anchor that your ship uses to propel itself through space. While I'm not quite sure what your end goal is, you set out to fulfill bounties by tracking down four different fugitives, each requiring you complete more ships than the last.</p>, <p>Captain Flinthook is armed with a basic gun that shoots plasma balls in any direction around himself, and a grappling anchor that can also be used in any direction. While the game is fully playable with a controller, movement and aim are mapped to the left stick with seemingly no way to change it. This is in contrast to playing with a keyboard and mouse where the mouse controls your aim independent of the direction of your movement. That said, both control schemes are serviceable, though being able to aim with the right stick would have been appreciated and made the two options feel a bit more on par. You can also momentarily slow down time, which is useful when there are many enemies and bullets to avoid. Apparently, there is also an evade button, according to the game's options menu, but I couldn't seem to get it to do anything on either control method. Weird.</p>, <p>Regardless of control discrepancies, I found the control scheme easy to pick up, and natural. The hook can be used to quickly move around via latching onto golden rings strewn about each room. Many times the use of these rings isn't optional as entire rooms will have no safe points to stand, but no worries, there are no one-hit kills in this game and health can be extended over time. </p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tep1b7jkfyw" width="1280"></iframe></p>, <p>Health isn't the only thing that can be upgraded; your gun, hook, movement speed, and various consumable sub weapons can be as well. Upgrades are found in chests and on ship shops using gold, unlocked via packs earned by leveling your character from gold, or purchased from the black market on the main menu via special black market coins found in chests throughout each map. Upgrades come in the form of equippable perks of which you can only use so many at a time based on the number of points you have unlocked to do so. You can also buy more perk points in the black market. While there are a ton of different perks to unlock, I never found many of them all that useful aside from having my bullets go a bit further and extra health.</p>, <p><em>Flinthook</em> isn't particularly difficult, but that could be thanks to me putting nearly all of my perk points towards health when available. During the last bounty, I believe I was able to be hit close to 20 times before dying. But without taking my health addiction into consideration, I found most of the enemies pushovers. Heck, most of the ones you find on the first bounty simply float in the air not attacking, and die in one hit, which isn't a great impression to start out with. Thankfully the further you go on the harder the game gets as it introduces stronger and more difficult enemies. The bosses are where the real challenge lies, but the game makes sure you're ready for them since they each have attacks that are similar to lesser enemies found throughout the ships that proceed them. </p>, <p>The flow of the game is pretty simple: choose a bounty of the four unlockable, complete the required number of ships, fight the boss. Each ship acts as its own randomly generated standalone map. These maps are made up of shops, obstacles, rewards, secrets, and rooms where you're locked in until you kill all the enemies that spawn, awarding you a chest accompanied by a pleasant sound effect; a small touch that makes getting them rewarding till the end. Chests mostly contain gold to spend at shops on board or food to heal you, and they can also be found tucked away behind spikes and other obstacles in certain rooms, just begging you to try to get them.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="810" src="../ul/431806-/FireBelow3rdBounty_0225-noscale.jpg" width="1440"/></p>, <p>The actual maps themselves are mostly laid out in a sort of linear way in that there is one path to the end with side rooms that are shops or chest rooms. Once I figured this out I'd step through doorways in each direction off of each room to see what kind of room it was, as most of the time if it had another exit, it meant it was the path to the end. If not, it probably had a chest or shop in it. This process wasn't exactly fun, but more so tedious, since it otherwise meant backtracking through each ship to check rooms I'd passed by, although I'm not sure how it could have been designed better. I suppose I preferred that to the ships with the labyrinth modifier that meant there was no obvious direct patch to the end.</p>, <p>Between each ship, you're given a selection to choose from, each marked with different modifiers. Modifiers include things like the aforementioned labyrinth layout, but also infestations of certain enemies, low gravity, curses, and the kinds of shops or collectible items you'll find on board. There are a couple different collectible items to find, pages that give you the lore behind an item or character, and relics which appear to serve no purpose, although I'm sure there is some hidden meaning behind them.</p>, <p>As far as lore and story goes, there isn't a lot here, at least on the surface. No new story is revealed between levels aside from the intro of the game, the intro of the final bounty, and the ending. The lore pages, while interesting, do little more than give you background on characters and locations. Of course, I'm missing a majority of both lore and relics, so perhaps there is more to it than I'm seeing after ranking up to level 41 after 13 hours of gameplay, which was how long I needed to finally complete all the vanilla levels one time.</p>, <p>I say "vanilla" levels because hard versions are unlockable from the black market, which probably offer the challenge I wish the rest of the game had. Unfortunately, these harder variations cost a lot of black market coins, meaning you'll have to grind the easier levels to buy them. That seems counter-intuitive, in that it may burn out the more skilled players before they ever even unlock them. As a rogue-lite with randomly generated maps made up of what is most likely hundreds of different room selections, I don't see enough variety for most people to want to keep playing after they finish the final bounty. While I thoroughly enjoyed my time with <em>Flinthook</em>, I just don't see a reason to play more, personally. Those wanting to figure out more lore or unlock every item and perk will get a bit more mileage than my 13 hours.</p>, <p><img border="0" src="../ul/431806-/Surrounded2ndBounty_0325-noscale.jpg"/></p>, <p>Aside from gameplay, I love this soundtrack. Tracks match the tone and settings perfectly and reminded me a great deal of Danny Baranowsky's work for <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer. </em>I was actually surprised that it wasn't him behind this score, which should be a huge compliment to <em>Flinthook</em>'s composer as I consider Danny one of the best. I especially loved the game's intro theme and the tutorial level that sounds exactly what I'd picture a space pirate's life should sound like. Also like <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em>, the shops each have their own tunes that are just delightful, although they lack any vocal tracks.</p>, <p>This is going to sound stupid, but I think my favorite part of <em>Flinthook</em> is breaking stuff. Each ship is littered with bottles, boxes, and other breakable materials that almost always contain gold when shot and destroyed. I've always loved breaking stuff in games, ever since the light gun game <em>Area 51</em> let me do so. I guess you could say I'm the Fred Durst of video games...because I like breaking stuff. Get it? I'm all about that he said, she said bullshit.</p>, <p><em>Flinthook</em> is a fine video game that sunk its hooks into me with easy to pick up and play gameplay, a catchy soundtrack, and cute characters. It's easily a recommendable rogue-lite for any fans of the genre or platformers in general. Just don't expect the game to anchor you to your seat unless you're the kind of person that needs to uncover every piece of treasure possible. Even if you aren't, <em>Flinthook </em>is a dandy game, in space. </p>, <p><sub><span>[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]</span></sub></p>, <p class="center"><b>Flinthook</b> reviewed by Jed Whitaker</p>, <p>Impressive effort with a few noticeable problems holding it back.

I was able to hit the end credits in something like 15 hours, spread over a week, and I've since come back to suss out more of the lore-dense world. During a busy release schedule like the one we're currently knee deep in, that's about the ideal length.</p>, <p>The other major thing going for <em>Shiness</em>? Combat. It takes an arena fighting game approach, enabling you (and also your foes) to perform combos, block, parry, cast spells, and even tag in teammates. As someone who tends to grow tired of less active RPGs, that design choice was an absolute godsend.

Early on, I feared <em>Shiness </em>might buckle under its own weight, both as a moderately-sized RPG from an indie studio and as an ambitious crowdfunded project. It doesn't make a great first impression.</p>, <p>There are lots of moving parts, some of which aren't up to par in terms of execution, and some of which are simply dated. You'll solve rudimentary puzzles by weighing down switches with rocks, or by routing colored energy beams between nodes. You'll sit through uncomfortably still cutscenes in which characters stand there, chatting at length. You'll wonder if things are ever going to improve. They will.</p>, <p>The game's fantasy setting and anthropomorphic characters stem from a manga; in my case, that meant I didn't fully grasp who was doing what or why at first. I'm still sort of hazy, even now, though some of that is intentional. <em>Shiness </em>throws you right in with two protagonists, Chado and Poky, crashing their airship in an unwelcoming land. It's not that we haven't seen warring kingdoms, elemental spirits, or floating islands before, but I struggled to keep up with the menagerie of proper nouns.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxTjMu7mIKU" width="560"></iframe></p>, <p>The short of it is that Chado (amusingly pronounced "Shadow") can see and speak with the Shiness, a spirit of great importance and the impetus for him getting caught up in a wider conflict.</p>, <p>Truth be told, you can get along fine with <em>Shiness </em>even if you skim through its familiar, text-heavy narrative. The story was serviceable enough to keep my attention, but I found the generally lovely art direction, pleasant music, and engaging combat system to be the true motivating forces.</p>, <p>The game is split into open-ended but discrete zones that are conjoined by loading screens. The general flow goes a little something like this: You'll catch wildlife for parts you can sell or barter with to acquire better gear; strike monsters to initiate closed-arena fights; and use character-specific abilities to circumvent obstacles. Some areas are wide open fields, others are snowy mountains, and others still are light dungeons. Aside from a few instances where I was utterly stuck on how to proceed due to vague instructions, I found the pacing to be great and the constant variety of landscapes surprising.</p>, <p>The other high point is the fighting itself.<em> Shiness </em>hinges its combat system on punches, kicks, blocks, dodge rolls, and parries, as well as RPG-staple elements like water, earth, and fire that can be refueled by "channeling" at the appropriate time. There's... a lot to learn. You'll recruit a five-character party, but you can only ever have three active members as you roam the world, and fights are one-on-one (with your two pals buffing you, or tagging in as needed). By the end, you'll need proficiency with all of those aspects and fast reflexes, particularly when it comes to the brutally unforgiving multi-phase bosses.</p>, <p><img border="0" src="../ul/431751-/h3-noscale.jpg"/></p>, <p>In general, <em>Shiness </em>does a decent job of keeping you on your toes without feeling too overwhelming or unfair, but certain enemies do have a tendency to use spammy tactics, forcing you to play similarly or stockpile healing items. It's also not as visually polished as it could be. From the outside coming in, my big concern for the game was that the combat would eventually become stale, but it ended up being intricate and demanding enough to hold my interest the whole way through.</p>, <p>I appreciated that the more drawn-out, fetch-some-trinket quests are largely relegated to side activities, helping to maintain a brisk critical path. But part of that quick pace can also regrettably be attributed to uninspired puzzles, which ask so little of players as to feel obvious and boring.</p>, <p>All told, <em>Shiness </em>is an uneven adventure, but one I'm glad I undertook. While it's too ambitious for its own good, deep down, and despite some hard-to-overlook faults, you can just sense that this was a passion project. I'm not sure if Enigami will get to make a sequel, but if it does, I'd be up for it.</p>, <p><sub><span>[</span><span>This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]</span></sub></p>, <p class="center"><b>Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom</b> reviewed by Jordan Devore</p>, <p>Slightly above average or simply inoffensive.

Voodoo won't woo you</span></p>, <p>With the release of <em>Banjo Kazooie-</em>inspired <em>Yooka Laylee</em>, the upcoming <em>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</em>, and the revival of <i>Psychonauts</i>, 3D platformers are re-emerging in mainstream gaming. Whether this will just be a short-lived nostalgia trip for gaming as a whole or if the genre is here to stay remains to be seen, but a number of re-releases have given us a chance to re-evaluate old classics or even have a first crack at the more niche titles that slipped by us.</p>, <p>Originally an Xbox exclusive released back in 2003, <em>Voodoo Vince</em> never received more than a cult following, failing to garner the widespread acclaim that its peers got. Myself a lifelong fan of 3D platforming collect-a-thons, I was eager for a chance to not only play but review one I missed. Unfortunately, <em>Voodoo Vince</em> fails to make the big-league cut with <em>Psychonauts</em> and <i>Banjo Kazooie</i>, instead faltering to the practice squad among the likes of <i>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</i> and <i>Blinx: The Time Sweeper.</i></p>, <p></p>, <p>

The colorful art, mascot character, and unique premise of using voodoo dolls is an alluring facade that seduces you in, but its charm is left at the door. Or at least I wish it did. The premise and exposition is all rushed in the first three minutes like a dishonest husband trying to change the subject when asked about what he was doing until 3:00am. It goes by so fast I could only reiterate what Vince himself says: "Um...okay."</p>, <p>Basically, a woman named Madam Charmaine runs a voodoo shop and owns magical Zombie Dust that the main antagonist, Kosmo the Inscrutable, wants and finally manages to steal thanks to his goons. The Zombie Dust isn't really explained but meant to be understood as a source of power the yet-unseen bad guy wants for no real reason. There is no further plot development until the end of the game, just occasional cutscenes of Vince and Kosmo, who looks like Sheen from <em>Jimmy Neutron</em>, tossing dated and unfunny (even in 2003) insults at each other. Other characters appear in a single level and have no bearing on the overall plot, serving as mere quest givers and targets of Vince's impotent vocal jabs.</p>, <p>Not all games need to have developing narratives or complex character development, but when it's as bare as this, there is no foundation on which to establish character traits and from which to deviate from for humorous effect. <i>Psychonauts</i> has a very simple plot and one-note characters, but they are defined enough that their interactions are like that of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCwHzTsx5yY" target="_blank">aluminium and bromine</a>, whereas <em>Voodoo Vince</em>'s characters react like water and oil. Instead of comedy derived from each characters' inherent nature, we get surface-level breath insults and literal toilet humor.</p>, <p>The aesthetic of <em>Voodoo Vince</em> is its strongest point, including a fantastic remastering job. Vince himself looks great and he fits in the colorful world quite nicely. Playing this game in 1080p at 60fps sometimes made me forget it was released in the same year as <em>2 Fast 2 Furious</em>. Most of the enemy designs are bland, but I do like the redneck alligators and the "yiiip" sound they make, even if it perhaps too easy a design.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXO_UNWBuI0" width="711"></iframe></p>, <p>Considering masterful sound design and thematic music were critical in making games like <em>Super Mario 64</em> and <em>Banjo Kazooie</em> so engaging, I had higher expectations than I realized for <em>Voodoo Vince</em>. While the voice acting is actually pretty good, you forget about it since the writing and humor are so poor. The soundtrack, however, was unexpectedly dull. When you visit locations like a carnival, a Louisiana swamp, and a haunted house, you would imagine some catchy music would accompany the levels to help sell the atmosphere. Instead the music is royalty-free tier without much variation, at best sounding like it belongs in <em>The Sims</em>. The sounds of attacking and picking up the few collectibles lack that oomph-factor, failing to entice you to collect more like the eggs in <em>Banjo Kazooie </em>do.</p>, <p>So then, with a throwaway plot and average aesthetic, we're left to rely on the gameplay alone for entertainment. At its core, <em>Voodoo Vince</em> is a 3D platformer with collectibles and puzzle elements. Aside from moving and jumping, you can glide to gain more distance and perform either a slap or spin attack. Pressing both of the triggers will unleash a special voodoo power, which will play a cute animation where Vince injures himself, killing all the enemies in range. Unique actions are all performed in context-sensitive locations. You can collect more voodoo powers for special animations, such as Vince pooping in an outhouse and killing enemies with his stinky green gas, but they are merely different animations that have the same function.</p>, <p>Other collectibles are bottles of Zombie Dust which give you extra health when you collect 100 and Skull Pages which, upon collecting all in a particular level, place a pink skull on the map that you must race to collect and gain extra meter for your voodoo power. On top of mediocre collection sounds, they aren't placed in thoughtful ways that test your platforming skills, and the skull races are downright annoying.</p>, <p>Beads dropped from regular enemies charge your voodoo powers, but you'll usually avoid confrontation due to rudimentary and boring combat. Furthermore, voodoo powers don't harm bosses, so you won't really need the extra meter. And since most of your deaths will come from falling into bottomless pits rather than from the combat you'll avoid, you won't need extra health all that much either. So why collect them? I collected them all in my 100% playthrough of the game, and there is no reward nor even any sort of acknowledgment of your achievement. Collect the new voodoo powers if you're curious to see different animations, I guess.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/431598-/VVR_LaunchAnnounceScreenshot_006-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p>I harp so much on collectibles because they extend an otherwise short game and collecting them is tedious rather than challenging or fun. They distract from the strongest point of the gameplay, the okonomiyaki-style level variety. Nearly each level is unique in its goals and puzzles, which in itself is interesting and makes the whole playthrough moderately enjoyable. The problem is none of the elements are around long enough to develop or compound into interesting mechanics you use through the game. They are over as soon as you understand what they are doing, and not all of them are fun.</p>, <p>In one level early on, you have to carry a fuel tank from the bottom of a tall chamber to the very top, using elevators and avoiding fire, which is as fun as it sounds. Any wrong move makes the tank explode, sending you back to the start or to the halfway point where you can get another. Dropping a pixel of height makes it explode, and even standing too close to the wall on an elevator will cause the tank to clip on the way down and explode. You have to get past fire that spurts out on a timer, a mechanic as old as platformers themselves. </p>, <p>Other levels featuring a plane to fly around obstacles and an on-rails shooter are more entertaining, but their simplicity is nothing to write home about. You'd think some of them would explore the idea of harming Vince as a means to injure enemies, since the makers thought the idea had enough potential to warrant a voodoo doll as a main character, but that element is never used in a puzzle context.</p>, <p>Searching for what made this game get a cult following, I thought perhaps it would be clever boss battles. They are unique in appearance, but in function they are not enthralling encounters. If you believe in the idea of bosses being a test of the abilities you have learned, you'll be disappointed as you just use basic actions known from the start, since you don't develop or learn any new skills throughout the game.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="720" src="../ul/431598-review-voodoo-vince-remastered/j-noscale.jpg" width="1280"/></p>, <p>Bosses do not rely on your combat ability and, as previously mentioned, cannot be harmed by voodoo powers. There is one way to attack each, and you perform that same action three times with minimal development. The bosses may walk faster or throw a bit more debris, but that's it. You clear each by finding a way to harm Vince, using the power of voodoo to transmit that injury to the boss, which you'll often forget since that idea is not explored elsewhere except in those voodoo power animations. Attacks from the boss hurt Vince, but don't in-turn hurt the boss, weirdly.</p>, <p>What little puzzle-solving or challenge there may be in the game is often explained away as soon as the level loads. Madam Charmaine narrates the level introduction, laying out exactly what you have to do. Bosses are no exception, where she'll explain how to win but not the act of harming Vince. Some of the "puzzles" such as shooting Vince at a certain target consume a lot of time if you miss. Others that make you perform the same action multiple times are tedious even if you never mess up, such as a level where you have to platform around the entire circumference of a room to hit a switch at least three times, and then a fourth time to get to the exit just beyond the switch. </p>, <p>With lackluster plot, awful comedy, and shallow gameplay, I just don't see where the following comes from. <em>Voodoo Vince</em> should be commended for trying to add variety and humor, but ultimately the execution is not there. Perhaps harsh on a game that is no worse than mediocre, I did experience brief nuggets of bliss, but they were rare. More often than not you'll be frustrated, leading you to believe you're the real victim when Vince sticks pins into himself.

Vroom in the Night Sky</em> is not only the worst game on the Nintendo Switch, but easily one of the worst games I've ever had the displeasure of reviewing. This game is so bad, I can't imagine how or why Nintendo allowed it to be sold on its marketplace aside from the fact it needed more content on the console. That or someone held a gun to Reggie's head until he agreed to let them sell the game on the eShop (take note indie devs).</p>, <p>In this hot trash you play as a witch that rides through the air not on her trusty broom, which she has with her, but various scooters. That sounds funny and silly, right? Like, how can you fuck that up? I'd like to imagine the developers at Poisoft had a brainstorming session to come up with every way possible and then implemented them into the game.</p>, <p>Your goal in this garbage game is to fight with the slippery imprecise controls to fly through and/or shoot missiles at giant circles with stars in them while being barked at in horribly translated broken English by a flying creature and an evil witch that poses no actual threat at all but for some reason spawns on every stage. You can also pick up or shoot stardusts, which are also earned by doing 'cool moves' like braking and 'not driving an airplane into skyscrapers ending your miserable life.' These stardusts act as currency that can be used to buy other bikes that control even worse than the one you start with, but hey they go faster so I guess that is a win, right? </p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BVptGhlrhw0" width="1280"></iframe></p>, <p>The stages in <em>Vroom in the Night Sky</em> are all big open squares filled with a few obstacles here and there, some of which even have textures. Can you believe it? But they all look like something you'd expect to find in a game on the original PlayStation or even the N64, as they are all blocky and hideous.</p>, <p><em>Vroom</em> features the much-hyped HD Rumble, which means your controller constantly rumbles in the exact same way the entire time you're accelerating your dumbass witch through the air. While this feels good against your nipples, clitoris, and dad-hole, it can't really get the job done as the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons don't work when placed inside of yourself, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nintendo-switchs-joy-con-sync-issue-is-even-worse-if-you-put-it-in-your-butt" target="_blank">as I've proven</a>. Also, by the time I was done playing the game my hands were tingling and exhausted from the constant rumbling.</p>, <p>Maybe the most laughable part of <em>Vroom in the Night Sky</em> is the localization, which is the proverbial cherry on top of this shitty cake. I've played plenty of bad localizations in my day, but this is easily the worst. It's so grammatically broken it rarely even makes sense, pending you can read past the typos. Yes, they didn't even bother to spell check it, let alone pay someone to localize it properly.</p>, <p><img border="0" src="../ul/431540-/C9ajhjLUAAAhIDX-noscale.jpg"/></p>, <p>Do you ever think to yourself "I wonder what <em>Kirby </em>music would sound like if played on a Casio keyboard by a deaf geriatric at a Russian flea market?" Then you'll absolutely adore the soundtrack of <em>Vroom in the Night Sky</em>. All of your favorite MIDI sounds are back, and they can only be heard in this Nintendo Switch exclusive. Okay, maybe it isn't that bad, but it is pretty awful.</p>, <p>You know the most messed up thing though? I played through this entire game and even got all but one of the in-game achievements because I'm clearly a masochist. It really pains me to say that getting the last achievement would certify me as "skilled Magical Girl" and I don't think I'll ever get it. I just can't bring myself to grind through more of <em>Vroom in the Night Sky</em> just to buy all the shitty mopeds just to get a meaningless reward that probably changes nothing.</p>, <p>The Nintendo Seal of Quality is long dead, but at least you can take your shovelware on the go now.

Mixing a unique style with gratuitous violence and a self-reflective story, the game asked players to question why they were so willing to murder in video games all the time. Was it something to do with a damaged psyche or was it more animalistic?</p>, <p>While the sequel failed to live up to the original, not many other developers have even attempted to tackle the same style of gameplay. We’re definitely seen overhead shooters and brawlers before, but nothing that captures the intense difficulty and careful planning that defined the <i>Hotline Miami</i> experience. Team Shifty has taken notice, though, and is looking to up the ante.</p>, <p>Being sold on the idea that this is <i>Hotline Miami</i>-like, <i>Mr. Shifty</i> basically apes the gameplay from Dennaton Games’ brawler and introduces teleportation. Why, exactly? That doesn’t matter; you’ve got goons to beat up!

The plot behind <i>Mr. Shifty</i> is that you’re a thief with teleportation abilities breaking into a highly secured tower to steal a plutonium core. The why for this plan isn’t ever revealed; the only information you have is that Shifty is an expert at what he does. Being guided by the hilarious Nyx, Shifty encounters a bunch of armed guards that he easily dispatches with some punches.</p>, <p>Saying the plotline is important would be wrong. <i>Mr. Shifty</i> presents itself in a comical manner and never beats you over the head with philosophical statements about violence. Instead, this is more like the PG-13 version of an X-rated film; people definitely die, but you won’t be seeing dismembered limbs or spurts of blood anywhere.</p>, <p>Your commander, Nyx, basically tells you to kick ass, kick some more ass, and to keep kicking ass when stuff goes wrong. She is no-nonsense and self-assured, cracking jokes about how your plan is "certain death" or how you’re encountering "minimal resistance." It works to make you chuckle and stop focusing on the absurdity of each challenge.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PslLAK67vSM" width="1280"></iframe></p>, <p>The bulk of the game is made up of the same kind of combat challenges from <i>Hotline Miami</i>. You enter rooms loaded with guards and need to figure out how to eliminate them without getting killed. You can attack with your fists or pick up weapons to dispatch enemies. One shot (or punch) means death, so you can’t just blitz through an area freely. What does change up the combat is your teleportation ability, which allows you to phase through certain walls or quickly dodge bullets.</p>, <p>Along with that, you can build up a meter that allows you to slow down time. After enough consecutive kills, you’ll be given what amounts to an extra hit point. When a bullet comes close to you, time will slow down and you’ll be able to run away or destroy everyone on screen with quick attacks.</p>, <p>Armed with those techniques, you can be more reckless than in <i>Hotline Miami. </i>The combat takes a tone that is faster-paced and more reaction-based. You don’t need to spend nearly as much time scoping out areas since, if trouble comes barreling towards you, you often can quickly shift through a wall to defend yourself or take a bullet and destroy everyone around you.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/430967-review-mr-shifty/20170411120158_1-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p>It makes for cool scenarios where you’ll take out a couple of guys, see maybe seven running at you, and then phase away to flank them. There are also moments that are straight out of <i>The </i><em>Matrix</em> where you’ll dodge a bullet, slowmo around the room, and smack some jerk out a window. The only way this is letdown is how slow the AI is to react to your movements (even without the slowmo). If it weren’t for your single health point, <i>Mr. Shifty</i> would be fairly easy.</p>, <p>Enemies love to funnel through single doors, so you can often take out a dude, phase through a wall, and then just wait for the goons to pour in. This results in the game mostly feeling stress free. The enemies do eventually give way to fools with grenades and that brings about the best change to the formula: destructible environments.</p>, <p>While the AI doesn’t get better (those grenade dudes love to blow themselves up), in later sections, hiding behind walls isn’t a sure thing. Sometimes a guy wielding a rocket launcher will blow open your only defense, meaning enemies will now funnel through the much bigger hole to attack. This near-suicidal dedication to assaulting you can be used to your advantage as enemies are able to kill each other.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/430967-review-mr-shifty/20170411114037_1-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p>Some of the later "puzzles" even focus on that, surrounding you with heavy brute enemies and a lone guy with a rocket launcher. While you can take out every last person with your fists, clearly tricking the RPG man into blowing up his comrades is the way to go. Rocket turrets also present a similar challenge, albeit without as many extraneous enemies around.</p>, <p>Even with those kinds of scenarios, the combat eventually becomes repetitive. While <em>Mr. Shifty</em> does introduce newer enemy types at a decent pace, the difficulty resorts to simply increasing the number of on-screen foes rather than organically presenting a challenge. You’ll die solely because you failed to react fast enough or there was no reprieve from the onslaught of bad guys.</p>, <p>It doesn’t help that checkpoints are room-based. In the final two levels, you’ll go through a hundred enemies in a single room before you get a chance to relax. While it can make you feel like a badass to conquer such stark opposition, it mostly just feels tedious. You often want battles to end solely so you can move on and get over with it.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/430967-review-mr-shifty/20170411121726_1-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p>I feel this is exactly the same problem <i>Hotline Miami 2</i> had: the game is too long. I know four hours isn’t some epic journey or even that long, but it stops presenting unique challenges after 12 levels. Once you reach the end of Act II, you’ve seen all of the tricks <i>Mr. Shifty</i> has to offer. There is even a fake-out ending with the final “boss” that could have worked to perfectly wrap up the whole affair.</p>, <p>Instead, the game throws an additional six levels of goons to go through that culminates in a hilariously easy final encounter. After that, it just ends without much fanfare. Nyx doesn’t chime in to congratulate herself and Shifty doesn’t even say anything. It sucks the wind out of the whole ordeal.</p>, <p>It doesn’t help that the art direction doesn’t change between each area. I suppose you can make the comparison to something like <i>Die Hard</i> with the tower you’re infiltrating, but you’re never looking at a different theme for any level. They all have the same corporate building aesthetic and it drags on.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/430967-review-mr-shifty/20170411122052_1-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p>The music is also the same for every level. <i>Hotline Miami</i> punctuated its grotesque displays of carnage with an equally thumping soundtrack. While the savagery was brutal, you often felt compelled to kill because of how primal the soundtrack was. <i>Mr. Shifty</i> sort of sounds like <i>James Bond</i>, but never mixes it up.</p>, <p>There is a pretty neat theme for the bigger encounters and I’m not even saying that the music is bad, but it doesn’t have the variety that helped carry <i>Hotline Miami </i>through similar lulls in its gameplay. Taken on its own merits, it just becomes stale after a while.</p>, <p>That really is the biggest complaint I have with <i>Mr. Shifty</i>: it becomes formulaic. It definitely is fun and I like how creative some of the fights are, but when the cleverness dries up and the theme never changes, it’s hard to stay enthused about the whole affair.</p>, <p>While the combat may have some depth and the game is certainly tongue-in-cheek, it just doesn’t present enough new ideas to sustain itself. I think it’s worth a playthrough, but I don’t believe we’ll be talking about <i>Mr. Shifty </i>for years to come. Just as quickly as Shifty himself enters and leaves a room, so too does this game enter and exit your mind.</p>, <p><sub><span>[</span><span>This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]</span></sub></p>, <p class="center"><b>Mr. Shifty</b> reviewed by Peter Glagowski</p>, <p>Slightly above average or simply inoffensive.

It also happens to be a touch-based VR game that you need expensive hardware for.

While <em>Superhot VR</em> is still my go-to "you have to check out VR" game, <em>Robo Recall</em> comes very close. With an intuitive system that uses two <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-oculus-touch-399349.phtml" target="_blank">Touch remotes</a> as hands, grabbing and firing guns is as simple as gripping them and pressing the trigger. It's crazy to see how far light gun games have come in my lifetime, from the NES Zapper, to the Wii, to a decked-out, beautiful Epic Games production.</p>, <p><em>Recall</em> greatly benefits from an over-the-top arcade setup that hearkens back to '90s lightgun shooters like <em>Revolution X</em>, with benefits like grabbing infinite guns from your holster at any time. There's never a dull moment, as you could be grabbing a robot, ripping its head off, tossing enemies into each other for explosion multipliers, grabbing bullets out of the air and throwing them back, or going full-on akimbo with your guns (sideways or crossed if that's your thing).</p>, <p>There's a few short motion and marksman tutorials, but <em>Recall</em> literally puts the game in your hands. Within seconds I have to decide what the best course of action was from the choices listed above, and that doesn't include defensive options like dodging or moving around with the teleport system (controlled by the left analog stick). If you aren't used to Touch-based experiences it'll take you a while to acclimate, almost like you're learning how to use two analog sticks or a keyboard and mouse in tandem for the first time. Like many VR games that have dropped in the past year or so I love that feeling of lawlessness, like I'm starting from square one again.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIK4D0kVlIs" width="853"></iframe></p>, <p>All of that freedom comes at a price though. I found myself bumping more in-house items than ever before, and I have a decent room-scale space. The tether of the Rift also bothered me for the first time, as the game is heavily built around 360 degrees and given the fast pace I whipped the cord around a few times and had to step or jump over it. This is something that took me 30 minutes to get used to, tops, but if you're in a smaller space your mileage may vary.</p>, <p>I know it's an action romp but I wanted to see a more heavily involved narrative beyond "stop these renegade robots from running amok." Every level or so you'll get a few bits of narration from your AI overlord, but it's simply not enough. You'll enter this universe by way of the natural assistance of the VR headset and the close-up action, but those off-moments (like when you're messing around in the hub) need a little more spark. The writing teeters on the edge of annoying or meme-heavy, but never crosses that line.</p>, <p>These are all just minor annoyances, but the way <em>Robo Recall</em> handles progress is its only truly weak element as it seems to be at odds with itself. It's basically an arcade shooting gallery with all of the bonuses that modern high-end VR benefits from, but there's a strange weapon upgrade system that ultimately feels pointless. Players earn "star" ratings, and you can use those to bump up each piece of kit a tiny bit, granting access to bonuses like laser sights or more stability. All of that should have just been unlocked from the start in favor of expanding the campaign beyond three main areas, all of which are city-based.</p>, <p><em>Robo Recall</em>'s few flaws just feed into the notion that I want more of it. I'm sure it cost a pretty penny for Epic to develop, and with the install base right now of VR, it may not even fully pay off. But if more deep-pocket developers are able to take risks like this and make more of these pushes, we might see VR hitting the mainstream yet.</p>, <p><span><sub>[This review is based on a retail build of the game downloaded for free with an Oculus Touch.]</sub></span></p>, <p class="center"><b>Robo Recall</b> reviewed by Chris Carter</p>, <p>Impressive effort with a few noticeable problems holding it back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth most people's time and cash.<br/><b>How we score:  <a href="//www.destructoid.com/the-official-destructoid-review-guide-2011-203909.phtml">The Destructoid Reviews Guide</a></b><br/></p>][<p id="modal1Title"></p>, <p id="modal1Desc"></p>, <p id="data-vidsummary"></p>, <p><span id="subtitle-large">Mamba No. 6</span></p>, <p>Locomotion is something that far too many video games take for granted. Standard fare for movement is often reduced to holding an analog stick in a direction and you'll get where you need to be. This approach is so ingrained in game design that when something as experimental as <em>Snake Pass</em> comes along, it sticks out as a stark reminder of what developers could be doing (not that they all need to be doing it).</p>, <p>There's a certain progression of emotion to playing <em>Snake Pass</em>. First, it's novel. Then, it's brilliant. Then, it's frustrating. Eventually, it's an amalgamation of all that other stuff but maybe more tedious than anything.

The mechanics of being a serpentine and your tactile connection to them are the core of <em>Snake Pass</em>. It's also the absolute best the game has to offer. Forward movement of Noodle (the snake's name is Noodle) requires holding a trigger and (excuse the pun) snaking the analog stick left to right to simulate a sidewinding motion. The other trigger can be used to grip, a way to cling tightly to whatever obstacle you're coiled around. A face button is dedicated to lifting Noodle's head, a maneuver that often makes just the slightest bit of difference when trying to ascend a ledge.</p>, <p>It's all so goddamn smart. Neatly slithering across the ground is good and all, but weaving through bamboo poles to further stabilize yourself is downright skillful and savvy. There's a learning curve to <em>Snake Pass</em> and it won't be long until you feel like you've mastered it. You've really got the hang of this Being A Snake thing!</p>, <p>Humility will come swiftly as <em>Snake Pass</em> is a fickle mistress. The difficulty ramps quickly as you suddenly realize that you definitely do not got the hang of this Being A Snake thing. I'm not convinced the obstacles get significantly tougher, though; it seems that they just get bigger, extending the amount of time you have to be proficient at snake stuff. The unforgiving (yet perfectly realistic) physics will probably cause Noodle to eventually lose his grip. <em>Snake Pass</em>' hardest challenges are the ones where Noodle is unsafe the longest, not ones that require tricky and clever movements.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kW9uDgo7nlA" width="711"></iframe></p>, <p>The reason for all this snaking is in the name of collectible hunting. Each of <em>Snake Pass</em>' 15 levels has 3 keystones that are necessary to proceed, along with 20 orbs and 5 golden coins. The latter are completely optional. The coins usually are found alongside the hardest platforming in the game, and the orbs are just sort of barely off the beaten path. Neither of these are particularly important as they don't tie into a reward of any kind. They're just a pair of statistics to max out on the level select screen.</p>, <p>This leads to <em>Snake Pass</em>' greatest disconnect from a design perspective. Combing the environment for a missing collectible or two is prohibitively taxing given how long it takes to retread areas you've already explored. But, <em>Snake Pass</em> treats these with relative indifference so maybe you should too. Beating the game endows Noodle with an ability to see all the collectibles in any given level, but that's probably of little consequence for those who are content just getting through the game once.</p>, <p>Noodle isn't completely alone in this venture. He has a hummingbird sidekick. Doodle (the hummingbird's name is Doodle) serves to add some flavor text throughout the adventure, but his more important use is that he can lift Noodle's tail. This can help get him up to a hard-to-reach area, but it might also shift the snake's body in a way that causes him to go tumbling. Tread carefully.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/429731-review-snake-pass/SP2-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p>If Doodle is Noodle's greatest ally, then the camera is his greatest adversary. On too many occasions, the view will be just off enough that it's impossible to know which micro-movement is necessary. In particularly perilous situations, you might have both index fingers on a trigger, the left thumb on the left stick, the right thumb on a face button to hold Noodle's head up, and find yourself needing to also move the camera with the right stick. It's irritating, especially when you know you were in position to succeed.</p>, <p>The edge to all those frustrations is eventually dulled, though. You come to accept <em>Snake Pass</em> for what it is, you learn to expect whatever niggling annoyance is going to happen next. It's all easy enough to come to terms with, like <em>Snake Pass</em> is some sort of anesthesia. More than anything, I just found myself wishing it were over sooner; fifteen levels is a lot of ground to cover, especially when the game does little to meaningfully vary gameplay.</p>, <p><em>Snake Pass</em>' legacy won't be any of that negative stuff I mentioned. It'll be remembered as a quirky thing that's an exemplary example of how games can offer non-traditional experiences. And, to be quite honest, I love it for that. I thoroughly enjoyed my first hour or so as I leaned into its serpentine sensibilities.

First, let me say I've played and enjoyed most of the <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em> titles. Sure, plenty of them are simple, but many have enough going for them that my friends and I want to go back to these games whenever we have a get-together. I can honestly say I don't feel that way about <em>Use Your Words</em>. </p>, <p><em>Use Your Words</em> works much like the <em>Jackbox</em> games in that players must use a secondary device (typically a phone) to open a web browser and connect to the servers to play along with the game on whatever television, monitor, or live stream they're in front of.</p>, <p>The game then presents either non-English clips where you must fill in the subtitles for a section, comical pictures to provide newspaper headlines, fill-in-the-blank questions (many of which are pop-culture references), and a lightning round that is straight up the lightning round from <em>Family Feud</em>, only three questions long.

In all seriousness, the whole game is just too shallow to be recommendable. On top of that, the amount of time it takes to cycle through answers after each prompt feels a bit longer than would be ideal.</p>, <p>In a world where $25 gets you five diverse party games in each of the <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em> collections, asking $15 for one flimsy game is just offensive.</p>, <p><sub><span>[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]</span></sub></p>, <p class="center"><b>Use Your Words</b> reviewed by Jed Whitaker</p>, <p>Went wrong somewhere along the line.

I enjoy some aspects of it, such as his wild facial expressions and his critiques of older game mechanics. He makes many interesting observations about the games I used to play, and showcases many others I'm glad I missed out on. The jokes are usually hit-or-miss, however.</p>, <p>With a video game version of his show, I would expect a nice mix of everything the Nerd stands for, and that's sort of what we get. James Rolfe as a sprite walks around with his signature exaggerated grimace, there's a bit of observational humor regarding the habits of retro video games, and tons of references to the show itself and the types of games he's often found playing. But in this case, the jokes missed a bit too often.

There's a conundrum with making a game based on a show that points out bad design choices in other games. Do you make it fun to play while discussing the things that other titles do wrong? Or do you make it poorly designed on purpose in order to highlight those issues for the player? With <em>AVGN Adventures</em> and its sequel, they sort of took the middle ground with an adequately designed platformer that also purposely throws in problematic elements, and I'm not sure how effective it is.</p>, <p>Enemy placement is meant to be frustrating, powerups are placed in unfortunate areas rendering them virtually useless, and blocks and traps that can kill in one hit are used in overabundance. These things were no doubt done on purpose to emulate the games that the Nerd likes to yell about, but they're still not particularly fun. Most levels are reduced to a frenzied race to the next checkpoint in order to stay alive.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sqPH9AXW9g" width="560"></iframe></p>, <p>The plot is simple enough. Alien forces turn everyone in the world into pixelated monsters. Only the Nerd is spared, who wakes up in his room and embarks on a quest to collect the six pieces of the Sexforce (perhaps a cleverer joke than I first thought). Along the way, he'll constantly be running into his nemesis, the Nostalgia Critic, along with familiar faces from the web series like Board James and the Nerdy Turd.</p>, <p>The map is laid out like the <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> overworld. The player can visit one of five areas, each containing three levels plus a boss fight. These include a Japanese-themed shoot 'em up stage, an homage to the electric seaweed level from <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, a <em>Ghouls 'n Ghosts</em>-ish horror area, a board game world, and an area inspired by <em>Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie</em>. There's also a bonus Virtual Boy level before the final boss. Overall, it will take most players about two to three hours to complete.</p>, <p>Individual stages try to vary up the gameplay with new mechanics, like shoot 'em up sections, driving segments, <em>Portal</em>-esque warping, and more. But for the most part, it's a standard platformer, often with hordes of enemies ready to strike from every direction and one-hit-kill death blocks aplenty. The death blocks seemed to be a common complaint about the first game, and the trailer promises there are less of them this time around, but I'm not so sure that's an accurate statement. They are everywhere.</p>, <p>Once again, the Nerd is armed with his trusty NES Zapper to fight off enemies, who explode in a mess of blood and guts when killed. This time around, there are no unlockable characters. Instead, the Nerd can collect his stuff which has been scattered all over the place, like the Power Glove and the Super Scope. These act as upgrades to make him more powerful and grant new abilities.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/352113-/avgn1-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p>There are also a few temporary powerup items, but they're mostly useless. The bouncy balls are basically a joke item, and the badge that upgrades the Zapper is really only useful in a few situations. The f-bombs are handy for taking out powerful foes, but the weird placement of f-bombs within each stage meant that I very rarely was able to actually use them. The only reliable powerup is the beer keg, which fully restores health.</p>, <p>Some of the boss fights were interesting, like the one at the end of Monster Madness (the <em>Ghouls 'n Ghosts</em> inspired area) which had multiple forms covering the gamut of stereotypical Halloween monsters. Others were simply an exercise in frustration, particularly the boss of the Japanese area that takes place upon treadmills. The mid-bosses, which include the Nostalgia Critic, Board James, and Nerdy Turd, all play out exactly the same. They're essentially the Protoman fights from <em>Mega Man</em>, just running back and forth shooting at each other until someone wins. The final boss was also surprisingly easy.</p>, <p>As far as the jokes go, they got a couple chuckles out of me. Standout goofs included the introduction of the tanuki (giant tanuki balls will get me every time!) and the end of the Monster Madness boss fight, which was probably my favorite moment. Other than that, the humor mostly revolved around excessive swearing and poop jokes, with the occasional mocking of terrible mechanics, so if that kind of stuff is your jam then you'll probably get a kick out of it.</p>, <p>For the sequel, they decided to forgo the elaborate curse word generator after every death in favor of an expletive-rich one-liner spouted by the Nerd at the end of each level. This means reloading after dying happens much quicker, which is nice. The one-liners are often rather predictable though (the sewer levels are literally shitty, we get it). Interestingly, the only levels he didn't have one-liners for were some of the Monster Madness stages, probably because they were actually great and he knew it.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/352113-/avgn3-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p>The critique of retro mechanics is the thing I was anticipating the most as I started playing, since the web series hinges on that very concept. There were a few clever moments, like when he points out a block-sized pit that he can simply run over, questioning why it's even there at all. I would have enjoyed seeing more stuff like this.</p>, <p>Other such moments fall flat when he decides to mock mechanics that are actually pretty cool. For example, the Monster Madness area starts out entirely in black and white with a grainy filter, with later levels incorporating a color-changing mechanic to reveal new platforms. I thought it was a neat idea, but the Nerd firmly disagreed, exclaiming, “What kind of stupid game has a color button?” There's also a level with gravity-flipping mechanics that seem to be taken directly from <em>VVVVVV</em>, to which he complains, “The gravity flips every time I jump? What is this bullshit?” Well, Nerd, it's called <em>VVVVVV</em> and it's awesome! Maybe these were references to other games of lesser quality that I never played, but I kept wondering why they weren't making fun of actually bad design decisions and instead chose to mock things that worked.</p>, <p>While I've talked extensively about the things that didn't quite do it for me, I will say this: if you enjoyed the first game, or if you're a diehard fan of the web series or the movie, you will more than likely appreciate this sequel. For everyone else, including those like me with only a passing interest in the web series, it's a very hit-or-miss experience. If you enjoy potty humor and language filled with more “fucks” and “shits” than you can shake a stick at, then <em>Angry Video Game Nerd II</em> is definitely for you. If not, then I might suggest looking elsewhere to get your platforming fix, because while the actual gameplay is decent once all the humor has been removed from the equation, it's still not the greatest.</p>, <p>At least it's not a shitload of fuck. The trailer got that part right anyway.</p>, <p class="center"><b>Angry Video Game Nerd II: ASSimilation</b> reviewed by Ben Davis</p>, <p>Slightly above average or simply inoffensive.

It's usually given to titles in a subgenre which, honestly, should be a lot more prominent than it is. Despite many tries, non-Nintendo developers have yet to nail the platform fighter. What most of these developers fail to realize is beneath <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>' mascot appeal lies a base appealing to both casual party goers and more dedicated players. </p>, <p><em>Rivals of Aether </em>is going to mean more to the latter. Welcoming comparisons to the aforementioned<em> Super Smash Bros</em>. (even going so far as to challenge it in some areas), <em>Rivals of Aether</em> is a platform fighter stripping away most of <em>Smash Bros</em>' zanier elements while focusing on a stronger, speedier, brutal core.

The land of Aether is separated into warring elemental factions: Water, Fire, Earth, and Air. When a shadowy force threatens the word, the titular rivals jump into action. Choosing one of the six characters -- with two unlocking later -- throws you into <em>Rivals of Aether's </em>frenetic gameplay in no time. Character design is fun, and I'm a particular fan of playing as a whale with arms and legs, but each of their play styles will be immediately recognizable to anyone who's played a fighting game before. There's the slow but hard hitting character, the tricky character with delayed actions, characters who set up traps, and fast but less strong types. But what makes <em>Rivals</em> stand above other standard fighting game archetypes, however, are the elemental tricks. </p>, <p>As mentioned, each character has an element that factors into their move set and tends to have an effect on the stage as well. For example, Zetterburn (the fire lion) has a down special fire punch which not only can strike the opponent but leaves lingering fire on the ground causing burn damage for a few seconds. These also include passive abilities like Wrastor's air current side special which helps him traverse faster or Forsburn's obscuring smoke. Before I knew it,<i> Rivals </i>had eased me into even more competitive play than I had been accustomed in this genre thanks to not only factoring in how much damage each hit will do (and subsequently how far the opponent will fly) but where to initiate the attack. Although the objective is to damage your opponent until they eventually go flying off the stage, a la <em>Super Smash Bros</em>, there's an impressive meta game in the area around each character. Do I lay a one of Orcane's puddle bubble traps on the edge of the stage or do I try and do as much damage as possible and factor that trap into a combo? </p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFCf6Vurbq8" width="711"></iframe></p>, <p>Playing into this deeper metagame are the parries. Eschewing a traditional block, each character has a two-frame delayed parry which, when successful, will briefly stun the opponent and opens them to a counterattack. Parrying is deeply satisfying as each one is accompanied by a "ding" and a glowing circle. It's appropriate since every hit feels just as weighted and important. For the first few hours, I played <em>Rivals of Aether</em> traditionally. Used dodge rolls, parried a few attacks, and relied mostly on my specials and strong attacks (read as: smashes), but the longer I dived in the more its advanced techniques started to reveal themselves. And this is where <em>Rivals</em> truly distances itself from its inspiration.</p>, <p>Tutorials go in-depth on more inside baseball terms like "frames" and "hitboxes" (which you can turn on in the training mode), and suggested strategies for each character. Advancing through those open up optional tutorials teaching short hops, wall jumps (there's no ledge grabbing here, instead you have to short hop off the wall to maybe save yourself), and even how to alter the trajectory of the angle you go flying. Whether or not I actually played like one is up for debate, but I felt like a pro. That's something that's never happened to me before. I just wish I was able to take my skills online. <em>Rivals</em> offers ranked and player matches, but I only played a few rounds with a handful of people. Unfortunately, the community isn't full enough just yet to really test out the netcode. </p>, <p>While the gameplay is frenetic and fun, <em>Rivals of Aether</em> may not appeal to everyone, however. The frenetic and fast pace can eventually skew into frantic territory as the speed of combat takes some time to get used to (a gamepad is absolutely necessary). And I may really enjoy the arcade feel to its story mode (and more importantly, its endless battle filled Abyss Mode), but some may find its presentation lacking. But there's a ton of personality that comes through its gameplay and how well its weaved into its characters. The 16-bit art style helps each character flourish; especially through elemental attacks. The best example of this is the ice bear, Etalus, who not only turns their fist into ice axes and hammers, but can absorb that ice and give themself giant ice jaws and it's pretty damn cool. Thanks to its tight focus, each character plays and animates as uniquely as this giving <em>Rivals</em> a much grander scale than its humble presentation would imply. Just as its deeper mechanics make itself known the more time is invested, the art flourishes grab your attention more the longer you play. </p>, <p><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/429193-/ss_e0a2786b6ca19b85d3e4c6d03ad098856689065d.1920x1080-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p>Thanks to a base inspired by <em>Super Smash Bros., Rivals of Aether</em> is able to dedicate itself to evolving the already familiar mechanics. Rather than break the game into wavedashing or applying directional influence by accident, creating a game with those advances in mind allows <em>Rivals</em> to become a more fully-fleshed out fighter. </p>, <p>Instead of dancing around the "is it a fighting game or not?" question plaguing Nintendo's major mascot title for years, <em>Rivals of Aether</em> goes full throttle into the genre and delivers an experience the platform fighting genre deserves. </p>, <p><span><sub>[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]</sub></span></p>, <p class="center"><b>Rivals of Aether</b> reviewed by Nick Valdez</p>, <p>A hallmark of excellence.

Punch! It's all in the mind</span></p>, <p><span>Beloved <em>PaRappa the Rapper</em> -- the game credited with birthing the rhythm game genre -- has kicked and punched its way to the PS4 for its 20th anniversary. A vestige of its time, <em>PaRappa</em> represents a colorfully wacky, beanie-wearing, rap-happy teenage life that virtually every <span>'</span>90s kid identifies with.</span></p>, <p dir="ltr"><span><em>Parappa</em>’s comeback to the PS4 leaves this rhythm time capsule fairly untouched save for updated crisp graphics and digitally remastered sounds. This is somehow all at once perfect, or terrible, depending on how you look at it.

Let’s start with the good. <em>PaRappa</em>’s original story is charmingly inane, but that’s why we love it, and why fans will fall in love again with its 2D paper-like characters. The remastered graphics bring PaRappa and his eclectic friends to life, literally making them look like they’re about to pop off the screen. The music is cleaned up, crisp, and still surprisingly good despite the silliness of the material.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Other new touches include a “help” section that contains some biographical information on the creators and also acts as an in-game manual. Add-on songs are also present, which allow the player to select different background songs to the raps in each level. This was a delightful surprise to me, since I thought these forever died when the PSP Store was taken down.  </p>, <p><img border="0" src="../ul/429305-review-parappa-the-rapper-remastered/PaRappa3-noscale.jpg"/></p>, <p dir="ltr">There’s also a few new options added to the gameplay, “See the beat” and “Feel the beat.” “See the beat” makes PaRappa’s little head icon pop to a larger size when you press a button, and “Feel the beat” essentially vibrates the controller to the beat to help calibrate the player. I found that the icon enlargement for “See the beat” was actually too distracting for me and ended up turning it off, however “Feel the beat” was slightly more helpful since it provided a separate set of calibration to the beats.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, this is where the believing ends. Despite the crisp graphics, the game itself feels very old, partly because, well, this is pretty much the first rhythm game ever created and we’ve since been spoiled with new advancements. However, more importantly, the remastered version does not include a calibration setting. This works very much against <em>PaRappa</em>’s favor as there’s an extremely noticeable lag throughout each of the levels, causing havoc when trying to hit the notes on time.</p>, <p dir="ltr"><img border="0" src="../ul/429305-review-parappa-the-rapper-remastered/PaRappa1-noscale.jpg"/></p>, <p dir="ltr">It was bad enough that despite my efforts to recalibrate my brain and timing to match the lag, I still couldn’t make it past the fourth level. Eventually it got to the point where I had to physically recalibrate my home theater system to make up for the timing difference so I could finish the game. It was a bit of an antiquated, not-so-charming side effect of an old rhythm game that I wish could have been solved through something like an A/V calibration setting.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Speaking of old systems, although I enjoyed looking at the original old-school <em>PaRappa</em> menus, I imagine the interface may be just as confusing to new players as phone booths are to teenagers nowadays. The in-game menu layout is practically completely unchanged, which means that because there are even more options in the remastered version, there’s a weird convoluted labyrinth of options to navigate.</p>, <p dir="ltr"><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/429305-review-parappa-the-rapper-remastered/PaRappa5-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p dir="ltr">As much as I love PaRappa and his quest to find love with Sunny Funny, the experience was significantly marred with the visible lag and the lack of calibration options. For a remastered rhythm game, this is practically a must-have given calibration difficulties with modern televisions.

When the first <em>Toukiden</em> came out a few years ago, it provided a hunting game with a satisfying action combat experience from the creators of <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> series and featured a very Japanese flavor. In the world of <em>Toukiden 2</em>, it has been two years since the first game and a decade since the "Awakening" when evil Oni (demon) monsters appeared to destroy mankind. The few humans left have only survived thanks to the Slayers, warriors who fight the Oni horde using Samurai weapons and magic.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Those who missed out on the first <em>Toukiden </em>can easily just jump into this title without prior knowledge of the story. At its core, <em>Toukiden 2</em> is still a hunting game where you go through the motions: fight monsters, gather items, use items to make better gear, and repeat. However, Omega Force returns again to give the genre a sorely needed improvement to the formula.</p>, <p dir="ltr"><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/428317-review-toukiden-2/Toukiden2_Screenshot11-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p dir="ltr"><em>Toukiden 2</em> features a new open world map for the single-player story mode, which is a first for the genre, for players to explore and hunt. Previous hunting games only offered small hubs that were more utilitarian wherein players selected missions from a menu. This open world features a small village that serves as a hub for a large map filled with varying terrain and locations. This new feature adds tremendously to the game’s narrative and world building, since many of these hunting games usually show so very little of the world you live in or are trying to save.</p>, <p dir="ltr"><span>The large open map's style leans more towards an MMORPG or </span><em>Borderlands</em><span> than an open world game like <em>Skyrim</em> with areas that are only filled with enemies to fight and items to gather. </span>There are large sections of the map known as the “Otherworld” that are divided in different “Ages.” These Ages have themes tied into the different past eras of Japan.</p>, <p dir="ltr"><span>At first, these areas will be enshrouded by deadly poisonous miasma emitted by the Oni invasion. This serves as a time limit for exploring these areas and it’s an automatic game over when you are reach the maximum exposure level. These are easily cleared out as you go along the game to a negligible level.</span></p>, <p dir="ltr"><span>This new open world format breaks up the monotony of item gathering that plagued hunting games. Repeatedly playing the same missions over and over just to farm particular materials (even though the latest <em>Monster Hunter</em> has made that part easier for certain items) has now taken a backseat to the action. Players now have the option to just run outside the gates of the hub village and start heading towards the target item's location. This open concept also has fast travel points that can be found through exploring the map.</span></p>, <p dir="ltr"><img border="0" src="../ul/428317-review-toukiden-2/Toukiden2_Screenshot13-noscale.jpg"/></p>, <p dir="ltr"><span>The areas might get a little confusing due to areas looking very much the same and players might end up getting lost a lot and having to consult that map often. But once you learn the lay of the land, traversal is a bit easier but consulting the map is still required. It’s easier to navigate on the PS Vita version, which has a lot less environmental elements such as trees and rocks, which does not really detract from the experience since they are purely cosmetic.</span></p>, <p dir="ltr"><span>The open world also allows for different RPG-styled quests to be done across the map with the usual fetch quests, scavenger hunts, and "kill X type/amount of enemies." Some of these little quests have their own stories and give the world a bit more life. These quests can get stale due to the limited nature of the quests but there are a reasonable amount they never overstay their welcome. There are also collectibles and regenerating item pickup spots scattered across the map that add incentive for exploration.</span></p>, <p dir="ltr"><span>I’ve made the comparisons to <em>Borderlands</em>’ open world style in <em>Toukiden 2</em> but the open world is strictly only available in single-player mode. Multiplayer is limited to the “Phase Missions” which is the traditional mission system found in hunting games and are conducted in small limited sectioned-off areas from the overworld map. This is one of the biggest disappointments in the game and the open world exploration could have been so much fun with other real people, something we can only hope to possibly see in the next iteration of <em>Toukiden</em>.</span></p>, <p dir="ltr"><span><img border="0" src="../ul/428317-review-toukiden-2/Toukiden2_Screenshot09-noscale.jpg"/><br/></span></p>, <p dir="ltr"><em>Toukiden 2</em> is one of those hunting games that actually has a story. It's very much helped by the new open world format that helps in the world building, especially showing how all the places connect together which gives a sense of a world. It takes place in Mahoroba village where the player character is thrust into all kinds of stuff such as internal politics and a bigger plot in the background. The story is decent but enough to get players going onto the next monster to take down.</p>, <p dir="ltr">As with the hunting genre, there is no leveling up levels but the <em>Toukiden</em> series has something close to leveling up using Mitamas. These are the souls of fallen warriors, some are based on real-life Japanese historical figures, which can be equipped to provide different battle styles and boosts for your characters, and using them in battle makes them stronger. There are about 200 different Mitamas and equipping each will yield different skills and boosts for combat.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Three Mitamas can be equipped in three different slots: Battle Skills, Evasion Skills, and Attack Skills. Mitamas will have different effects and battle styles depending on which slot they’re equipped on. There are about 11 different battle styles: ranging from the general ATK battle style that specializes in attacks, a more defensive battle style like DEF, to the support battle styles like HLG, which focuses on healing. There are all kinds to suit different roles and styles for the right situation.</p>, <p dir="ltr">There are over 11 weapons in <em>Toukiden 2</em> providing different styles of play: from the well-rounded Sword to fast slashing dual Knives to more complicated weapons such as the bow and the rifle. You can somewhat mash your way with some weapons like in the <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> games but some weapons require a good amount of learning and a lot timing. Weapons such as the rifle and bow do not work like they do in shooting games, so you have to time your shots well and learn the particular way the weapons function as well as to effectively use it in combat.</p>, <p dir="ltr"><img border="0" src="../ul/428317-review-toukiden-2/Toukiden2_Screenshot04-noscale.jpg"/></p>, <p dir="ltr"><span>A new feature in <em>Toukiden 2</em> are Joint Operations, which are points in the open world map where players can run into other online connected human player's AI controlled avatars engaged in combat with a mob of enemies. Once the enemy mob is cleared, the AI controlled avatar will join as a fifth party member which makes fighting large enemies easier. If  the character was from a human player, a data exchange will occur. If a player is offline, a generic stock character will be in the Joint Operation.</span></p>, <p dir="ltr">Another new addition in <em>Toukiden 2</em> is the Demon Hand and functions similarly to the grappling hook-like glowing wrist thing called Thorn from <em>Freedom Wars</em>. This adds vertical movement to the combat such as pulling your character up towards tall enemies to attack higher parts of the Oni. However, it doesn’t have that bit in <em>Freedom Wars</em> where you can latch onto the enemy and directly cut off parts.</p>, <p dir="ltr"><span>The Demon Hand also has different abilities such as pulling down large enemies and a very useful special move that cuts off an Oni part in one hit. It’s also used in the exploration of the overworld which can be useful for the occasional high ledge and crossing over gaps.</span></p>, <p dir="ltr"><span>New smaller features allow players to send out a little upgrade-able helper robot that gathers items in real time while in the game. There are also magical foxes called Tenkos that can raised and equipped with Mitamas that can help in combat.<br/></span></p>, <p dir="ltr"><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/428317-review-toukiden-2/Toukiden2_Screenshot10-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p dir="ltr"><span>Graphically, the PlayStation 4 version looks slightly better than an early cross-generation game because it is just that -- <em>Toukiden 2</em> is also on PlayStation 3 (only in Japan) and PlayStation Vita. The environments are a bit plain but the character models are great, which is good because those are what you’re gonna be looking at a lot. The performance on PlayStation 4 is great with a very fluid framerate, while the Vita version may dip in the mid 20s from time to time but is still very playable.</span></p>, <p dir="ltr">Like an MMORPG, there’s a bit of that jank in the in-game cutscenes. The stories are delivered in a canned manner, due to the game’s limited set number of character animations. While these seem like primitive in a game that elevates the genre, it gets the job done. The pre-rendered cinematics do look well-made when they pop up from time to time.</p>, <p dir="ltr">The voice acting is great, with a Japanese cast featuring a lot of seasoned voice actors that have been in many anime and video games. <em>Toukiden 2</em> could have used an English dub or more subtitles since there is rather charming random in-game chatter from party members in Japanese that I somewhat understand with my very limited beginner Japanese language skills.</p>, <p dir="ltr"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cMBWOVZL8LU" width="720"></iframe></p>, <p dir="ltr"><span>Like other similar games, it still takes a while to get going but there’s enough new stuff to see and do that can keep players busy while the game slowly opens itself up. </span>There’s a lot in <em>Toukiden 2</em> -- it is the most accessible and most modern entry in the genre so far. It’s the perfect gateway to hunting games that will surely attract newcomers and please fans of the genre.</p>, <p dir="ltr"><em>Toukiden 2</em> is a great leap towards a much-needed evolution, and it dares to add new things and challenge tradition. Hunting games usually get an enhanced edition that adds all kinds of stuff and I eagerly await what Omega Force will bring on next time around. In the mean time, I’m gonna play more of this game for a few dozen more hours.</p>, <p class="center"><b>Toukiden 2</b> reviewed by Red Veron</p>, <p>A hallmark of excellence.

The Gladiolus DLC just came out bro.</p>, <p>Check it bro, you can get a <em>shirtless</em> outfit for Gladiolus bro! And it carries over to the <em>main game</em>!

In a very DLC sort of way, Gladiolus steps away from the core party in <em>Final Fantasy XV</em> proper for a bit (during Chapter 7) -- that's where this episode takes place.</p>, <p>It's the Gladiolus show, yes indeed, and all of his raw combat power is showcased in this add-on that sees him undertaking a trial to beef up for Noctis. Strangely, Cor Leonis, someone who was barely touched upon in the campaign is here, and earns his place -- but only just a little. He's one of the most fearsome members of the military sworn to King Regis, but he takes a backseat here to the main bro. His inclusion merely serves as a light level of exposition and feels like a missed opportunity to delve further into life in the kingdom of Lucis, something that's glossed over in favor of giving us a reason to watch the <i>Kingsglaive</i> movie.</p>, <p>While it's easy to forgive some of the omissions as the story is easy enough to piece together, this would have been the perfect opportunity to push the lore a little more -- as it stands, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUsOpKnHtZY" target="_blank">the free anime episode</a> is more enlightening than this paid DLC.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TvrEoooCEd4" width="853 SHOW MORE"></iframe></p>, <p>In fact, clocking in at roughly an hour or two (if you do everything), there isn't much room for anything outside of a slight twist on the already fun combat system. Gladiolus is a little slower than what you're used to, but he does have the gamey rage meter that lets him charge up and unleash new abilities after getting hit or dealing damage. You're basically going to be blocking more than dodging and counter-attacking, which to its credit, does differentiate DLC Gladiolus from playing as Noctis. Pulling giant columns out of the ground and using them to bludgeon enemies to death is also a hilarious touch that meshes with the strongman theme.</p>, <p>That cool nuanced combat alteration (which will no doubt spread over into the other characters' DLCs) stops there. Episode Gladiolus is basically a dungeon you'd wander into on the open map, and almost feels like a loose collection of challenge rooms. A comparison Square Enix saw fit to address itself, as it even has a score attack mode that skips cutscenes and turns the whole affair into a speedrun-like deal. Bang bang, slash slash, fight [a more serious rendition of] Gilgamesh, and you're done. As previously mentioned, you <em>do</em> get a shirtless Gladiolus outfit that carries over into the main game, which is a cool little bonus.</p>, <p>As someone who absolutely loved every member of the bro-trip party, I was hoping for a little bit more from the first major round of <em>Final Fantasy XV</em> DLC. The game has already received a ton of fantastic free updates, but so far the "Episode" format seems to be something all of us should enjoy in the Game of the Year edition, and not piecemeal.</p>, <p><span><sub>[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.

It is that damned good.</p>, <p>In a year that has been absolutely filled to the brim with great games, I can say <em>Hollow Knight</em> is hands down without a doubt in my mind my favorite and surely an early contender for game of the year.</p>, <p></p>, <p>

All of the 100-plus characters are animated to be adorable and/or hideous, and the different areas of the humongous map each have their own art styles with some of the best use of parallax I've ever seen. One area has ghosts floating in the foreground, while others have sprawling jungles or caves with layers that move independently of each other to create much livelier levels than most 2D games can offer. After only seeing videos and screenshots of the game's first area, a dreary cave where everything is a shade of blue, I had my breath taken away the moment I got to the second area, a jungle. It was so colorful and alive.</p>, <p>On top of that, the soundtrack is one of the most memorable and whimsical scores I've heard in a long time. There are tracks here that I'd rank beside the music of <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Star Wars</em>. It is that damned good. Even the general sound design is great, as every enemy has different realistic scuttling sounds, and many characters speak in seemingly made-up languages I found myself quoting by the end of the game. One character you'll constantly run into is a cartographer, who can always be located by following pieces of paper found on the ground and the song he hums. In most games buying maps is possibly one of the most boring experiences, but in <em>Hollow Knight</em>, I got excited every time I heard the faint hum of the cartographer from afar, growing louder as I got closer to his often hidden locations. </p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UAO2urG23S4" width="1280"></iframe></p>, <p>The game takes place in an underground kingdom of bugs where many heroes have ventured for various reasons, yet never returned. Players assume the role of an adorable little insect (a beetle?) armed with nothing but a nail, which just happens to be the size of a sword for a bug. Why is this cutie venturing into the forgotten kingdom? It isn't clear at the beginning but the truth soon reveals itself in a lore that leaves a lot up to interpretation, in my opinion, but that is not a bad thing at all. Being spoon fed is not always the best way to take in a story.</p>, <p>Speaking of not being spoon fed, <em>Hollow Knight</em> encourages you to go explore as you wish. Most areas of the map are accessible early on, with certain areas in them only being accessible after acquiring items and abilities elsewhere. This meant that by the time I'd reached the credits for the first time, which took me 27 well-spent hours, I was pretty comfortable navigating most of the kingdom without looking at my map. Backtracking to areas I'd been never felt tedious. Along the way I'd be killing enemies to collect Geo, the in-game currency, as well as discovering previously unreachable areas and secrets, including a slew of challenging bosses.</p>, <p>Bosses aren't pushovers, even with grinding to get some of the better equipment to help out. Reflexes are definitely put to the test, especially considering most bosses are unique in their move sets, meaning each of the 30 boss battles provide a whole new challenge to overcome. Players that get frustrated easily might be turned off by some of the difficulty, but I never found any of the bosses to be unfair in their tactics. I can safely say this is one of the only games where I felt a sense of accomplishment after every single boss was slain, because there were no cheap tactics to speak of, be it on the player's part or the bosses'. </p>, <p><img border="0" src="../ul/427608-review-hollow-knight/20170318020812_1-noscale.jpg"/></p>, <p>Thankfully the controls here are tight, responsive, and on point. By the end of the game you'll be dodging, double jumping, slicing, dicing, shooting projectiles, and charging up attacks with ease and finesse. Mechanically you'll find most of the things you'd expect in the genre, but the one big difference here is the <em>Dark Souls</em>-like ghost you leave behind when dying. This ghost of your former self must be slain to regain the money you were carrying when you died, as well as make your 'bug juice holder' complete again. 'Bug juice,' as I've taken to calling it, is used to heal at any time by holding a button. This process takes a few seconds to start up and complete, meaning you'll be hard-pressed to do it during most battles, but boy did I find ways to do it during boss fights since it is almost necessary unless you're a golden god of gaming.</p>, <p>I love both of those mechanics. They circumvent a couple of issues games have always had, namely appropriate punishment for failing, and a risk-reward system. In most games when you die, you're forced to redo a portion of a level, or even to start from the very beginning, but here you're simply spawned back at the most recent save point -- in this case benches that are all begging to be screenshotted -- and tasked with making it back to where you died and slaying your ghost. Dying before you get there means losing all of your money, which sucks, but I'd argue is a good punishment. It drives players to try their best at all times. The same could be said about healing, especially during boss fights, as you've got to find the perfect moment to heal.</p>, <p>Another thing to love about <em>Hollow Knight</em> is the wealth of content. At 28 hours, I finished the game with around 85% completion rating, getting the bad ending. Judging by how much I still have left to discover, plus the two other endings I know exist, I could easily see myself ending up taking somewhere around 35 hours to 100% the game. This includes finding equitable charms that act as abilities, upgrades, and buffs, rescuing cute caterpillar babies, taking out optional bosses, and talking to a mysterious mushroom person among other things. I can't stress just how much there is to do and find here, with all of it feeling worthwhile and exciting. I guess you could say the game is anything but hollow -- on the contrary, it is cram-packed. </p>, <p><img border="0" height="1080" src="../ul/427608-review-hollow-knight/false_knight-noscale.jpg" width="1920"/></p>, <p>If it isn't clear, <em>Hollow Knight</em> is not only what I'd say is the best game so far this year, it also very well may be the best metroidvania title out there right now, and it is easily one of my favorite games of all-time. Truly a masterpiece of gaming if there ever was one, and certainly art worthy of being in a museum. This fact is even more impressive when you consider the game only pulled in around <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight" target="_blank">$43,000 USD on Kickstarter</a> and was made by a very small team of indie developers. Having played it on PC, I'll probably revisit it once it eventually comes to the Nintendo Switch at a yet-to-be-determined date, hopefully with an amiibo to boot (make it happen, Team Cherry!).</p>, <p>For a moment there I thought I was growing out of video games, but damn has this past six months restored my faith thanks to <em>Hollow Knight</em>, <em>Owlboy</em>, and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. We are truly living in a new golden age of gaming.</p>, <p><sub>[This review is based on a retail build of the game purchased by the reviewer.]</sub></p>, <p class="center"><b>Hollow Knight</b> reviewed by Jed Whitaker</p>, <p>No game is perfect, but comes as close as it could get within its genre.

Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUWiv5r_CZw" target="_blank">trying to pitch a show about nothing</a>.</p>, <p>Fortunately, things get quite a bit easier if you break it down a bit. <em>Everything </em>is a game about Every Thing. Simple, right?

I'd end the review there, but being a professional Games Journalizer, it is only prudent to continue. Every Thing in <em>Everything</em>'s little universe is playable, from the smallest rock to the largest galaxy. If it's rendered in the game as a distinct object, you can control it.</p>, <p>Exactly how to control it is a fairly simple process. Hold a shoulder button, and highlight that thing and voila, you are an ant. Or a juniper tree. Or a helium molecule. Or a continental landmass.</p>, <p>This, of course, raises the question of what exactly can be done in the game, once possessing an appropriately silly object. Well, you can move. Everything you "possess" is capable of movement, even rocks, trees, and other typically inanimate items. Singing and dancing are also options, allowing like objects to group together in swarms, rolling about the procedurally generated landscape like plastic toys falling out of a toy basket. </p>, <p><img border="0" height="708" src="../ul/425950-/ever3-noscale.jpg" width="1268"/></p>, <p>About the only thing you can't be in <em>Everything</em> is a person. There just don't seem to be any around, despite the presence of cities, buildings, cars, forklifts, and all manner of other artificial items. </p>, <p>That's not to say that there's no human touch to the game, though. The other thing to do in game involves hunting down little thought bubbles randomly dispersed across the universe, emitted by various objects. Most thoughts read like deep-thought tweets, but others unlock clips from the lectures of Alan Watts, the late British-American pop philosopher. These bits are what separate <em>Everything</em> from any number of vaguely profound art-games, as the lectures are, for now, exclusive, added to the game through a deal with the Watts estate. </p>, <p>The talks themselves promote a sort of universalist outlook, encouraging listeners to think of themselves as part of a larger existence, where distinctions between "self" and "other" are nothing more than mental barriers to a wider perspective. We are all star children, and so on. Dating back to the '70s and '80s, the "oneness of the universe" standpoint even seems a little quaint, but at the same time, it might actually be valuable to emphasize how interconnected everything is in a time when people are more divided than ever before.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdJk8ROpuEo" width="620"></iframe></p>, <p>I'm not equipped to tell you if that all seems very deep or not. I don't know what kind of philosophy or theology courses you took in school, so the impactfulness of the Watts talks will very from person to person. All the same, they were never boring to listen to, at least, and fit in with the game itself. <em>Everything </em>does its part to try to reinforce Watts' vision of a grander, more comprehensive perspective.</p>, <p>Despite the game's somewhat primitive graphics, there is something genuinely cool about being able to zoom out from the atomic scale all the way up to going outside the universe itself, into a meta-space inhabited by abstract shapes and planes. It's capable of inspiring a measure of awe, under the right circumstances (perhaps late-night circumstances, after a couple of drinks or a joint).</p>, <p>Beyond all that...there isn't much to <em>Everything</em>. If the sense of scale and openness don't grab you, it's unlikely the philosophizing will. Though there is something a bit "game-like" about trying to possess absolutely all the possible objects in the game's universe, it's unlikely anyone will ever bother to try.</p>, <p><img border="0" height="704" src="../ul/425950-/ever1-noscale.jpg" width="1256"/></p>, <p>And yet in its way, <em>Everything </em>feels to me like a mellow, less aggressive take on <i>Katamari Damacy </i>or <em>Noby Noby Boy</em>, a curious, reflective novelty that, for players in the right kind of mindset, can spark something profound.</p>, <p><span><sub>[This review is based on a retail build of the game purchased by the reviewer.]</sub></span></p>, <p class="center"><b>Everything</b> reviewed by Josh Tolentino</p>, <p>A solid game that definitely has an audience.

There are many video games from my childhood in the '80s and early '90s that I absolutely loved, but can’t push myself to play today because issues I could ignore or missed as an adolescent today stand out like a sore thumb. </span></p>, <p><span><em>The Legend of Zelda</em> is not one of those games. When it was released it changed gaming, and when I finally got to play it at five years old, it changed me and started a lifelong love affair with interactive entertainment. So well crafted, so forward thinking, the NES masterpiece is just as playable today, 30 years later, as it was when it was first released. Something tells me 30 years from now, when I’m 61, I’ll be saying the same thing about <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>.

The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild</em> solely against previous entries would be a disservice to the entire series. The classic <em>Zelda</em> formula still works when it isn’t bogged down by inane tasks. <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s go where you want to go, do what you want to do conceit isn’t any better or worse, it’s just different. If <em>A Link Between Worlds</em> was a chance to eliminate the staler elements that permeated <em>Skyward Sword</em>, this game is a palate cleanser for the whole franchise. </span></p>, <p><span>The story here is the same as it’s ever been: a boy with his sword challenges a demon that just won’t die with the help of a princess imbued with the blood of a goddess. In <em>Breath</em>, Zelda and the Calamity Ganon have been trapped in a 100-year battle at Hyrule Castle. The surrounding towns and villages were destroyed, their charred remnants scattered across the land as reminders of what has been lost. Link, gravely wounded in the fight, was taken to a restoration chamber, waking 100 years later with no memory of what transpired. Your overall goal is obviously to beat Ganon and save Zelda, but the road to the final confrontation will be paved by your actions and your decisions. </span></p>, <p><span>It’s quite well known at this point that <em>Breath of the Wild</em> features an open-world design. Spending 54 hours in it, it’s one of the most open worlds I’ve ever experienced, reminding me very much of an MMO with all the level restrictions removed. Once you finish with The Old Man at The Great Plateau, you’re free to go in any direction you want, conquering the game as you please. For me, that meant running around discovering all of the Shiekah Shrines I could. These puzzle and combat trials, built centuries ago, offered many wonderful opportunities to use the Shiekah Slate.</span></p>, <p><span><img border="0" src="../ul/424295-review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-wii-u-/Breath5-noscale.jpg"/><br/></span></p>, <p><span>Obviously inspired by the Wii U GamePad in the same way the Tingle Tuner was obviously a Game Boy Advance, the Shiekah Slate is as close to a classic <em>Zelda</em> item you’ll find here. Using it, you can take pictures, create bombs, whip up blocks of ice, manipulate metallic pieces, and freeze time on an object, allowing you to strike it repeatedly with your weapon to send it flying. While early Shrines point to just a few options for the device in puzzle solving, the real-world applications of it proved to be quite versatile. Beyond uncovering secrets, I found many different ways to use the slate to my advantage. Ice blocks could serve as a quick bridge or shield, stopping time on a massive slab of rock let me jettison it right into an enemy encampment, and I was able to use the magnetic feature to steal weapons before the enemies could grab them. Plus bombs, which are perfect for making things go boom. </span></p>, <p><span>The depth at which I used the Shiekah Slate is great, but I feel an even more important change in design direction is how this game isn’t setting you up to succeed. Past <em>Zelda</em> games, with their linear progression, have always prepared you for the fight you have ahead. You were given the right tools at the right times and the land was littered with bombs, arrows, and enough rupees to fill any size wallet. In <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, you’re destined to fail unless you go out of your way to find the supplies you need. Foraging for food because there are no heart pieces, stealing weapons off of enemies because yours are close to breaking, cooking up dishes because there’s no easy-access potion shop – success isn’t handed to Link, he and you have to earn it.</span></p>, <p><span><img border="0" src="../ul/424295-review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-wii-u-/Breath4-noscale.jpg"/><br/></span></p>, <p><span>That was a fact that took me many, many hours to figure out for myself. I spent too much playing this game as if it were every other <em>Zelda</em> game, even though all the signs were telling me to do otherwise. It wasn’t until I died for what felt like the 50th time fighting my second dungeon boss that I realized I had to change how I played. Like John Rambo in <em>First Blood</em>, I had to actively prepare for the fight to come and while a montage of me gathering fruit and cooking bugs wouldn’t pack the same punch as watching Sylvester Stallone assemble spear traps that make you wince in pain at the thought of them, that careful and time-consuming effort paid off just the same. </span></p>, <p><span>With all that planning, I was finally able to challenge the dungeon bosses with confidence. Unless there are some hidden in a remote part of Hyrule, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> has only a handful of dungeons. They’re almost purely puzzle-based, meaning you can conquer them in any order you like. Activating every switch in the dungeons required me to put my thinking cap on, and with a healthy amount of experimenting, I was able to unlock the keys to each one and make my way to the boss battle. With no dungeon-specific items to collect, these boss battles, one of which was aggravatingly difficult, tried my combat skills like no other. There were patterns I could follow, yes, but actually defeating them required lighting-quick reflexes, thorough competency in the controls, and extensive planning, including making sure I had enough weapons to defeat them.</span></p>, <p><span><img border="0" src="../ul/424295-review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-wii-u-/Breath1-noscale.jpg"/><br/></span></p>, <p><span>Weapons break and they break often. Some didn’t last a single encounter and there have been times I had to cycle through three different melee tools to defeat one enemy. I’ve been annoyed by breakable weapons in the past, but here I never reached a point where I became disgusted by the concept. Replacement weapons are easily available and, with the Shiekah Slate and stealth skills, I could easily steal swords and clubs before Bokoblins had a chance to use them on me. </span></p>, <p><span>There’s a nice variety in the weapons too. Sword and shield combos, two-handed spears that are ideal for mounted combat, clubs of all sizes, and boomerangs that could be used as a short sword and a projectile that returns to you. The further I went in the game, the more durable weapons I came across, eventually ending up with the Master Sword. If the game were less generous with new weapons, the fragility of my armaments would have been an issue. </span></p>, <p><span>Now, this review may sound like I’m just full of endless admiration for the game, oblivious to the issues found within, but it’s easy for me to admit it’s not without its flaws. The framerate can actually stutter to a stop, inventory management could be less cumbersome, I encountered a few instances of overlapping dialog in the cutscenes, it takes an unusually long time to come out of the home menu – which might be a feature and not a bug – and it quickly became annoying to stop the action every time the Blood Moon returned my fallen foes to the world of the living. There’s also the fact that outside of off-TV play, there are no GamePad-exclusive features.</span></p>, <p><span><img border="0" src="../ul/424295-review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-wii-u-/Breath3-noscale.jpg"/><br/></span></p>, <p><span>I get those concerns exist, I just don’t really care. Not one of them dampened my enjoyment of this title in any way or took away from the pure joy of picking a direction and just going. The topography of Hyrule is so thoughtfully littered with points of interest, its siren song seducing me to each tower, to each shrine, to each interesting rock formation that actually turned out to be a puzzle. The sense of discovery here is like nothing I’ve felt in a long, long time. </span></p>, <p><span>There is no other way to put this: <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> is brilliant. It is magnificent. It is marvelous, amazing, fantastic, and every other synonym for the word wonderful that can be found in the thesaurus. If <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> was the flint that ignited the passion I have for video gaming, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> is the 500lb bag of charcoal that will keep that fire burning for decades to come.</span></p>, <p><span><span><sub>[This review is based on a retail build of the game purchased by the reviewer.]</sub></span><br/></span></p>, <p class="center"><b>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Wii U)</b> reviewed by CJ Andriessen</p>, <p>No game is perfect, but comes as close as it could get within its genre. The new game to beat in its sector; we're talking pure video game ecstasy.<br/><b>How we score:  <a href="//www.destructoid.com/the-official-destructoid-review-guide-2011-203909.phtml">The Destructoid Reviews Guide</a></b><br/></p>][<p id="modal1Title"></p>, <p id="modal1Desc"></p>, <p id="data-vidsummary"></p>, <p><span id="subtitle-large">The joy of snipping</span></p>, <p>The game selection on Nintendo Switch right now is decidedly sparse, but I don't mind. Two titles are keeping me plenty busy, and if you've glanced at the eShop yet, I bet you know 'em.</p>, <p>The first, of course, is <a href="../review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-419788.phtml" target="_blank"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a>. That game card isn't leaving my system anytime soon. But the other? It's a last-minute addition to the launch lineup called <em>Snipperclips</em>.

Simply put, <em>Snipperclips </em>is a treat, no qualifiers necessary. While it's best played with a rowdy pal in co-op (there's Joy-Con support for up to four players), it's perfectly enjoyable as a solo experience.</p>, <p>This is a platforming-centric puzzle game about trimming and reshaping your blocky characters to serve some specific use and complete a task. Often times, you'll intuitively know what the goal is by looking at the screen and will have formed a rough idea of how to go about achieving it mere seconds later.</p>, <p>A basketball and a hoop? Yep, we got it. A pencil and a sharpener? Say no more! A bunch of lil' critters who can't fall asleep unless you reroute and contain the seemingly endless stream of floating sludge that's pelting them? Uhh, let me get back to you on that. I need to consult.</p>, <p><em>Snipperclips </em>might look overly simple -- sometimes it can be -- but the fun of it is that you're almost always trying <em>something</em>. The expressive art, level design, and puzzle objects are all so easy to read and suss out that I was quick to experiment and rarely if ever felt stumped into submission.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HSp-4OYElS0" width="560"></iframe></p>, <p>One of my favorite things to do in this game is to make my partner into a circle (in order to then fashion them into a gear that can seamlessly interlock with other gears). Our process, late in the game: One of us continuously rotates, and the other carefully walks into them while mashing the snip button, grinding away the excess until only a circle is left. That's just one possible way to turn a gear. The beauty of <em>Snipperclips </em>is in its playful spontaneity. You'll be so tempted to jokingly cut each other to pieces all the dang time that you can and will stumble into an inadvertent a-ha moment as you're goofing off.</p>, <p>All told, there are 45 main levels, with thoughtful pacing that rotates concepts in and back out. You'll also find around 20 extra levels built only for groups, and three side activities: head-to-head basketball, amazingly fun air hockey, and a mindless deathmatch. I was able to see and do everything in three play sessions, and in retrospect, I had a smile on my face the whole time. To my mind, the only downsides are that the platforming and physics can occasionally be slightly wonky, there's no Pro Controller support (you'll need a second Joy-Con pair to get a full group going), and not every puzzle type is explored to its full potential. There's room for more, and whether it's DLC or a sequel, I hope we get it.</p>, <p>I can't tell you how many times I thought to myself, "Oh thank eff they let me get away with that!" In the wrong hands, <em>Snipperclips </em>could have been infuriating or painfully dull, but it sidesteps those fates by striking this great balance between leniency and challenge. No one puzzle is too drawn out or precision-perfect to frustrate, and because there's room to come up with what will feel like novel solutions, just about every level is engaging to solve and execute. You'll hoot and holler and really get into it.</p>, <p><em>Snipperclips </em>is a terrifically charming package. It's one of those rare games I can flat-out recommend to everyone because odds are you'll have a blast with it, and so will anyone you share it with. If you're a Nintendo Switch owner, this deserves to be your next game after <em>Zelda</em>.</p>, <p><sub>[This review is based on a retail build of the game purchased by the reviewer.]</sub></p>, <p class="center"><b>Snipperclips: Cut It Out, Together!</b> reviewed by Jordan Devore</p>, <p>A hallmark of excellence.
