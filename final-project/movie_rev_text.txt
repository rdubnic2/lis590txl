</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="249">Teeming with acts both heroic and reprehensible, John Ridley’s wrenchingly humane documentary, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JGY-GjzKp4">“Let It Fall: Los Angeles 1982-1992,”</a> reveals the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/03/us/riots-in-los-angeles-general-and-troops-have-domestic-mission.html">Los Angeles riots</a> as the almost inevitable culmination of a decade of heightening racial tensions.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="563" data-total-count="812">To that end, this multiethnic oral history allows politicians and the police, victims and survivors who witnessed the events of April 29 and 30, 1992, to expose a relentless accretion of official decisions and public resentments. We’re almost 90 minutes in before the uprising begins, but not a second feels unnecessary: Rather, some sections are so powerfully elucidated by the movie’s commitment to context and nuance that even too-familiar tragedies — like the agonizing beatings of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/us/rodney-king-whose-beating-led-to-la-riots-dead-at-47.html">Rodney King</a> and <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/la_riot/article/0,28804,1614117_1614084_1614511,00.html">Reginald Denny</a> — arrive freighted with fresh insight.</p>, <p class="summary">"Let It Fall" takes a look at the years and events leading up to the city-wide violence that began April 29, 1992, when the verdict was announced in the Rodney King case.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="1131">“It was truly a war like no other,” says Jung Hui Lee, a Korean-American shopkeeper whose 18-year-old son, Edward Jae Song Lee, was mistaken for a looter and shot while trying to protect another business. His death, like others in the film, is indicative of a chaos that defies a simple black-and-white explanation.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="414" data-total-count="1545">Drawing from multiple visual sources, Mr. Ridley follows the rise of gang membership and drug use, and the troubling evolution of the policing tactic known as <a href="http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2016/04/gaining-compliance-with-targeted-pressure.aspx">“pain compliance”</a> (an escalating series of actions designed to subdue a suspect). Neither blame nor absolution entices him as, again and again (eased by Colin Rich’s masterly editing), he coaxes forth the perfect, shining moment that speaks volumes.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="571" data-total-count="2116">“He was only 20,” one woman says, distractedly, of the boyfriend who <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-29/local/me-40159_1_police-officer">died from a police chokehold,</a> as if she were fully registering his youth for the first time. Similarly, a telling encounter with a biracial juror plays like a spotlight on the complexities of tribal loyalty. But Mr. Ridley (whose terrific anthology series, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/arts/television/review-american-crime-season-3-abc.html">“American Crime,”</a> is currently in its third season on ABC) saves his most devastating device for last, sideswiping us with the realization that someone who has already touched our hearts might also, at one time, have turned our stomachs.</p>, <p>

</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="198">The cinema innovator and iconoclast Jean-Luc Godard never actually said, “All you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun,” but it has become a well-known adage, anyway — because it’s true.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="458" data-total-count="656">“Free Fire,” directed by Ben Wheatley from a script he wrote with Amy Jump, applies a more-is-more ethos to the formula: The ingredients here include a best actress Academy Award winner, Brie Larson; dozens of firearms; and a slew of male characters of varying levels of smugness and idiocy to help out with the shooting. The film is a formal exercise in spectacle under constraint: An extended standoff in a contained space surprisingly full of hazards.</p>, <p class="summary">The director Ben Wheatley narrates a sequence from the film.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="525" data-total-count="1181" id="story-continues-2">The story is set in the era of eight-track tapes and ultrawide lapels. Cillian Murphy plays an Irish gun buyer with a cause; Armie Hammer, Sharlto Copley and Babou Ceesay are among the idiosyncratic sleazebags doing the selling. The deal is going down in a grungy abandoned warehouse in Boston, with Ms. Larson’s character, Justine, acting as broker. Before things can conclude amicably, an unpleasant coincidence-among-lowlifes sets the gangs against each other. All hell breaks loose, ebbs, breaks loose again, and so on.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="425" data-total-count="1606">Mr. Wheatley’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/movies/high-rise-review.html">“High-Rise”</a> was a highlight of 2016, and again he shows that he’s a technically virtuosic director whose humor has a bracingly nasty side. He’s also no dummy. “Free Fire” is an action movie finely tuned to even the most potentially vicious audiences’ tolerances. It is filled with mayhem, but avoids grisly violence — at least until the finale pulls out some gory, and not inapt, punch lines.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="295" data-total-count="1901">Luxuriating in disreputability in all the right ways, the film also contains no shortage of profane verbal wit: From an impeccably delivered “Ugh, men,” from Ms. Larson, to a one-bit gunman’s complaint about hating a certain type of “freelance job” that he describes with an expletive.</p>, <p>

</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="621" data-total-count="621">A funny thing happened to the French director Bruno Dumont a few years back: He discovered whimsy, or at least something like it. Mr. Dumont made his feature debut in 1997, with the striking “The Life of Jesus,” which built on the unflinching confrontation of emotional extremes pioneered by the filmmaker Maurice Pialat. His subsequent works — including the harrowing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B01E1DC1538F93AA35757C0A9629C8B63">“Twentynine Palms</a>,” the enigmatic war film <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/18/movies/18flan.html">“Flanders</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/18/movies/18flan.html">”</a> and the gloss on Bressonian themes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/24/movies/24hade.html">“Hadewijch”</a> — are serious, searing pictures, replete with content and imagery that even the most adventurous viewer could find hard to stomach.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="848">But his 2014 television mini-series, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/movies/homevideo/lil-quinquin-and-the-wire-crimes-in-a-small-town-and-a-big-city.html">“L</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/movies/homevideo/lil-quinquin-and-the-wire-crimes-in-a-small-town-and-a-big-city.html">i’l Quinquin,”</a> about an impish kid caught up in a grisly murder mystery, added an antic playfulness to the Dumont vocabulary. And his new feature, “Slack Bay,” widens that scope.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="712" data-total-count="1560">“Slack Bay” is set in a tiny seaside community in northern France, sometime in the early 1900s. Here live two families. The “haves” are the wealthy Van Peteghems, whose patriarch, André (Fabrice Luchini), a simpering hunchback, presides (after a fashion) over an ominous stone manse on a hill overlooking the bay. The “have-nots” are the Bruforts, whose own patriarch is nicknamed the Eternal. They run a ferry service in which the Eternal and his oldest son, called Ma Loute (also the film’s French title), often hand-carry passengers over a marsh. Sometimes they use a boat. And on these trips they sometimes bludgeon their passengers to death, take the bodies to their humble home and eat them.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="422" data-total-count="1982">Into this mix blunder a pair of black-suited, derby-wearing police officers who would look as at home in “The Adventures of Tintin” as they might in a Mack Sennett short. One is overweight, and makes a lot of noise if he so much as crooks an elbow in his tightfitting suit. He also falls and rolls around a lot. Mr. Dumont is defiantly not above body-shaming humor. He probably has some philosophical rationale for it.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="411" data-total-count="2393">But wait. You may still be stuck on “and eat them.” Yes, the Bruforts are cannibals, which, among other things, puts a crimp in a possible romance between Ma Loute (Brandon Lavieville, jug-eared and bad-boy charming) and Billie (Raph, who resembles a teenage Natalie Portman), an androgynous cousin of the Van Peteghem girls, whose mother, Aude (a very hopped-up Juliette Binoche), is also a summer visitor.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="523" data-total-count="2916">As this family enacts a Gallic variation of the Monty Python <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwXJsWHupg">“Woody and Tinny Words” sketch</a>, the human body parts in the Brufort hut grow more numerous. This is a spirited and often gorgeous film (Guillaume Deffontaines, the cinematographer, makes the eyes of even the most ostensibly unattractive characters supernaturally beautiful), but it’s not an easy one. As it turns out, modes of farce and fantasy enable Mr. Dumont to pull the rug out from under the viewer in a number of new and upsetting ways. Be prepared.</p>, <p>

</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="614" data-total-count="614">The title character in “The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki” is a rabbity guy — nervous, jumpy and fast. He’s a boxer and always moving, as if he were constantly getting ready to take a swing or looking out for an opponent. A sweet, stealthy story about fighting the good fight in and out of the ring, the film opens with Olli (Jarkko Lahti) already in motion. He’s on a train and then in a car, listening to twangy rock ’n’ roll (the soundtrack gets your body moving, too) while driving to meet his girl, Raija (Oona Airola), a radiant beauty who has a heart-skipping way of slowing Olli down.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="708" data-total-count="1322">Sports movies usually involve obvious winners and losers, but “The Happiest Day” — a largely true story set in Finland in 1962 and shot on glorious black-and-white film — is interested in other matters. Olli is about to have the biggest bout of his career against Davey Moore (John Bosco Jr.), an American and the reigning world champion. The fight has been partly coordinated by an ex-fighter, Elis (Eero Milonoff), an amusingly oily, small-time hustler who’s working every angle he can as fast as he can. Elis is peddling the match as a spectacle, a Finnish benchmark. “You don’t have to go to America to see a great show,” he promises reporters, an oath that Olli seems less certain about.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="601" data-total-count="1923">Olli is humble, nearly to a fault, as perhaps befits a fighter known as the Baker of Kokkola, a moniker as attractively down-to-earth as this film. “The Happiest Day” centers on a boxer facing a personal milestone and training and sparring and sweating (and sweating) to get down his weight. But the director Juho Kuosmanen understands that what happens outside the ring defines a life, too, so he skips the usual triumphant moments and instead lingers over the big questions — the limits of ambition and, as the title suggests, the meaning of happiness — that might be glossed over elsewhere.</p>, <p class="summary">A preview of the film.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="719" data-total-count="2642">Mr. Kuosmanen, who wrote the script with Mikko Myllylahti, layers on scenes of everyday realism — two people skipping stones, a man on a lonely walk — that build an intimate, lived-in portrait. Shortly after “The Happiest Day” opens, Olli and Raija set off for Helsinki, where he’ll be training with Elis. It’s the first time that he will fight as a <a href="http://wbcboxing.com/wbceng/news/4789-boxing-weight-categories-and-catch-weight-fights" title="more on weight"> featherweight</a>, a marker that takes on significance as he struggles to make weight. He and Raija have other issues, having moved in with Elis, his wife and kids, a familial squall that (like the tots who pop up now and again) has a way of upstaging important adult matters. Life intrudes, as children and the film’s abruptly edited transitions underscore.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="728" data-total-count="3370">“The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki” deepens quietly. This is Mr. Kuosmanen’s first feature (he has directed a few shorts), and if he had any rookie jitters you wouldn’t know it. It’s a bit of a narrative slow-boil — the story arrives in pieces, in disconnected scenes and conversational fragments — but it grabs you right from the start. The most obvious reason is the dense, luxuriant black-and-white cinematography, which is very pleasurable in its own right. (I’d forgotten how much I missed seeing black-and-white in new movies.) Here, the absence of color works like a time machine, transporting you into the past, yet because it’s now so uncommon it also feels paradoxically fresh, not nostalgic.</p>, <p class="summary">The Times critic Manohla Dargis reviews “The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki."</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="731" data-total-count="4101">Working with his cinematographer, J-P Passi, Mr. Kuosmanen turns the black-and-white from a novelty into a strength, using grain and shades of gray to set the mood and tone in smoke-filled rooms and natural landscapes. For the most part, the characters — Olli most of all — don’t express themselves readily or knowingly (they’re pre-therapy). So Mr. Kuosmanen sticks fairly close to them in order to trace those tender, telltale filigreed emotions that settle into faces when the words don’t or can’t come. It’s lovely miniaturist work that echoes that of the performers, notably that of Ms. Airola and Mr. Lahti, who lets you see Olli’s interior life emerge gradually, as pure physicality gives way to sensibility.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="716" data-total-count="4817">“The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki” may take its inspiration from the life of a real boxer, but you wouldn’t know it from the film, which doesn’t have any of the usual biographical footnoting. (If you see it, pay attention to the old couple at the end and then stay for the closing credits.) There isn’t much about the real Mr. Maki in English other than his 1962 fight with the real Davey Moore. Mr. Moore died the next year after sustaining <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/17/sports/la-sp-crowe-20110718" title="more here">injuries</a> in a <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/fight-to-the-death-who-killed-davey-moore/" title="a look at the fight and its aftermath">brutal fight</a>, a tragedy Bob Dylan immortalized in the ballad “<a href="https://bobdylan.com/songs/who-killed-davey-moore/" title="more here">Who Killed Davey Moore?</a>” I don’t know if a Finnish balladeer ever sang of Mr. Maki, but this film serves as a charming testament to him and to the grace of an ordinary life.</p>, <p>

Ms. Heigl, looking carved out of ice, plays Tessa, who has not been coping well with her divorce from David (Geoff Stults). When he develops a serious relationship with Julia (Ms. Dawson), Tessa sets a diabolical plot in motion.</p>, <p class="summary">A preview of the film.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="572" data-total-count="1200">The setup may vary — sometimes it’s an unbalanced roommate, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/movies/review-when-the-bough-breaks-blame-a-scary-pregnancy-surrogate.html?_r=0" title="Related review">a surrogate mother</a>, or a sexy nanny who gets that homicidal look in the eye — but it’s the same three-cornered dynamic. Here, both the director (Denise Di Novi) and the writer (Christina Hodson) are women, yet that doesn’t translate into a reimagining of the tired formula. Tessa and David have a young daughter (Isabella Kai Rice) who becomes a pawn in the deadly game, and Julia is given a back story involving an abusive boyfriend, but the tale still plays out the same way these yarns always do.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="448" data-total-count="1648">That’s dismaying, because although this is a female-centered movie, the women’s roles are not exactly empowering. The formula demands that one character be bonkers and that the other not be smart enough to realize how unhinged her adversary is until it’s too late. It’s woman in jeopardy meets woman on the verge, a reductive brand of thriller from another decade, freshened here only with the addition of a plot element involving Facebook.</p>, <p class="summary">The Times critic Neil Genzliger reviews “Unforgettable”.</p>, <p>

Yeah, absolutely! It’s what I live and breathe and think and do all the time.” He’s contagiously cheery, and most of his sentences seem to end with an exclamation point or a sense of wonder. Even amid brutal conditions, he’s an intrepid and encouraging guide.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="476" data-total-count="1249">Listening to Mr. Naveen, though, is secondary to watching the views. Almost every shot of wildlife, distant mountains and violent seas is magnificent. Yet Peter Getzels, Harriet Gordon and Erik Osterholm, <a href="http://www.getzelsgordon.com/thepenguincounters/" title="Their website">who filmed</a> the scenes (Mr. Getzels and Ms. Gordon also directed), don’t romanticize the region, delivering footage that’s a bit scary as well as awe-inspiring.

</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="363" data-total-count="363">“Behind the White Glasses,” an effusive portrait of the Italian director Lina Wertmüller, the subject of a retrospective at the reopened Quad Cinema, wastes no time turning polemical. “In the whole history of the world, I think there have only been two great women directors, Leni Riefenstahl and Lina Wertmüller,” the critic John Simon says minutes in.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="669">Has Mr. Simon ever seen a movie by Lois Smith, Maya Deren, Ida Lupino, Agnès Varda, Vera Chytilova, Chantal Akerman, Claire Denis, Catherine Breillat, Jane Campion, Kelly Reichardt, Lucrecia Martel or Kathryn Bigelow? What kind of documentary positions that statement as authoritative in the 21st century?</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="328" data-total-count="997">A documentary stuck in a particular moment, perhaps — when Mr. Simon, one of Ms. Wertmüller’s staunchest champions, could proclaim her the most important director since Ingmar Bergman. Whether that sentiment has endured is dubious, and the movie treats Ms. Wertmüller’s poorly received post-1970s career with kid gloves.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="1272">The first woman nominated for an Oscar for best director, for “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173FE470BC4A51DFB766838D669EDE">Seven Beauties</a>” (1975), Ms. Wertmüller remains a divisive figure. Her fans saw her as an essential filmmaker of the 1970s. Her detractors pilloried her movies as sexist, politically incoherent and grotesque.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="184" data-total-count="1456">Among her collaborators, Giancarlo Giannini fondly remembers their many films together. Martin Scorsese posits “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9901EED7163FE034BC4052DFBF66838E669EDE">Swept Away</a>” (1974) as an essential conversation piece in its decade.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="448" data-total-count="1904">At its most enjoyable, Valerio Ruiz’s rambling profile cedes the floor to Ms. Wertmüller, who recalls her creative partnership with her husband, the production designer Enrico Job, and her cultural importance in representing Italy’s south onscreen. Turning 89 this year, she is still a vivacious storyteller whose trademark eyeglasses — she bought 5,000 pairs from the factory, she says — make her pop against even the dullest backgrounds.</p>, <p>

</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="192" data-total-count="192">Weighed down by the worthiness of its intentions, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnwgMYeaqr4">“The Promise”</a> is a big, barren wartime romance that approaches the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/23/world/europe/armenia-readers-stories.html">Armenian genocide</a> with too much calculation and not nearly enough heat.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="617" data-total-count="809">It can happen all too easily. An otherwise highly competent director (in this case, Terry George) succumbs to the lure of addressing a real-life atrocity (here, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/04/17/arts/ap-us-film-armenian-genocide-drama.html">still-contested</a> slaughter of more than a million peaceful Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War I). Somewhere along the way, though, the need to do justice to the slain and call out the perpetrators becomes a pillow that smothers every spark of originality. Even actors with the heft of Oscar Isaac and <a class="meta-per" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/christian_bale/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Christian Bale.">Christian Bale</a> — playing an Armenian apothecary named Mikael and an American war reporter named Chris — appear muffled and indistinct.</p>, <p class="summary">A preview of the film.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="551" data-total-count="1360">This dimming extends to an excruciatingly corny plot that has both characters vie for the twinkling affections of Ana (Charlotte Le Bon), a Paris-educated, terminally cute tutor. But first Mikael must finagle a dowry to finance medical school in Constantinople, so he promises to marry Maral (Angela Sarafyan), a lovely innocent from his village. Once in the grip of the city and Ana’s charms, however, Mikael is lost; the combined demands of a soggy love triangle and the approach of war soon banish all thoughts of marriage — to Maral, at least.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="655" data-total-count="2015">Mikael, then, is not particularly sympathetic, and Chris is a humorless newshound; so when the jackboots tramp and the killing begins, their fates are of less concern than they should be. And while Mikael endures the horrors of an Ottoman work camp, and Chris and Ana are busily saving orphans at a Protestant mission, their director — who was infinitely more adept with his other <a class="meta-classifier" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/rwanda/genocide/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about the Rwandan genocide.">genocide</a> movie, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/22/movies/holding-a-moral-center-as-civilization-fell.html?_r=0">“Hotel Rwanda”</a> — appears oblivious to the story’s inadequacies. Aspiring to the sweep of epics like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1iQ5hQTR5s">“Doctor Zhivago”</a> and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUwsrapJcA0"> “Reds,”</a> Mr. George achieves neither the romantic delirium of the first nor the sheer swaggering gumption of the second.</p>, <p class="summary">The Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis reviews “The Promise."</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="354" data-total-count="2369">Money does not seem to have been the problem: The film <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/promise-film-armenian-genocide-1201892838/">reportedly</a> cost almost $100 million, and some of it is even on the screen. Yet we never forget for one second that we’re watching actors in fancy dress; behind the curtain of cattle cars and starving workers, above the noise of the explosions, we can hear the moviemaking machinery clank and whir.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="432" data-total-count="2801">In 2002, the Canadian-Armenian director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/21/atom-egoyan-adoration-chloe">Atom Egoyan</a> took a more modest yet ultimately more potent path to the genocide with his underseen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tne7D73Zmqg">“Ararat.”</a> Though not entirely successful, that film — which directly addressed the cinematic challenge of representing history — profited from sharply perceptive writing and a studious avoidance of melodrama. With even one of these attributes, “The Promise” might have had a chance.</p>, <p>

This French documentary convincingly explains why those views are gravely misguided, but its real triumph is its pervasive feeling of hope.</p>, <p class="summary">A preview of the film.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="796" data-total-count="1250">It’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/world/europe/france-activism-elections.html?_r=0">refreshing to see concrete solutions</a> at work, many of them at the grass-roots level. And the optimism of those countering ineffective politicians and big business is infectious. The filmmakers — the French actress Mélanie Laurent and the civic activist Cyril Dion — interview their subjects during an intercontinental expedition that takes them to <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2015/07/11/lafayette-greens-spreads-gospel-farming-heart-detroit/30023311/">Detroit</a> and <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/pam_warhurst_how_we_can_eat_our_landscapes">Todmorden, England</a>, where urban gardening initiatives flourish; <a href="https://sfenvironment.org/zero-waste/overview/zero-waste">San Francisco</a>, which has an enviable recycling and composting program; <a href="http://www.fermedubec.com/en/">Normandy, France</a>, where intercropping ensures that “each plant plays a role in the ecosystem”; a village near Chennai, India, whose decentralized democracy reflects the residents’ priorities; Copenhagen, with its renewable energy model and biking culture; and many points in between.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="522" data-total-count="1772">At times, it feels as if the strikingly composed “Tomorrow” — fast-paced and divided into chapters focusing on food, energy, the economy, democracy and education — would have better served viewers as a multi-episode documentary series, with each theme getting its own segment. Yet the editing team helps evoke an overall sense of lighthearted adventure; the narration is punchy and personal; the pop score (mostly by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrnmQIbTRTU">Fred</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrnmQIbTRTU">ricka Stahl</a>) is catchy; and the hopscotching visuals are as vibrant as the subjects profiled.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="203" data-total-count="1975">The overriding message? It takes a community to make change. To paraphrase the Leonard Cohen song “Everybody Knows,” the dice may be loaded, but good guys can win, especially when they band together.</p>, <p>

</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="550" data-total-count="550">Much of Lydia Tenaglia’s diverting documentary, “<a href="http://jeremiahtower.film/">Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent</a>,” about one of America’s first celebrity chef-restaurateurs, is framed as a battle against vulgarity. Mr. Tower, an epicure raised as a lonely child amid chilly affluence, attended Harvard around the late 1960s before finding his calling. On camera, he remembers how, when student protesters invited him to “become a revolutionary,” he replied, “I’m too busy cooking.” He adds: “Drink Champagne and eat smoked salmon. That was my revolution.”</p>, <p class="summary">A preview of the film.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="764" data-total-count="1314">After college, in 1972, Mr. Tower alighted at Alice Waters’s pioneering Berkeley, Calif., restaurant, <a href="http://www.chezpanisse.com/intro.php">Chez Panisse</a>. Together, he and <a href="http://www.chezpanisse.com/about/alice-waters/">Ms. Waters</a> gave birth to the so-called California Cuisine, based on local ingredients and championed by the likes of <a href="https://www.jamesbeard.org/about/james-beard">James Beard</a>. After a falling-out with Ms. Waters, Mr. Tower founded the restaurant Stars, a magnet for San Francisco’s political and show-business glitterati, and was bestowed a Dewars endorsement deal. But Stars, overextended (it had branches elsewhere in Northern California and overseas), was damaged and ultimately undone by an earthquake in 1989. After years in retreat, Mr. Tower resurfaced in 2014 to resuscitate the ailing Tavern on the Green in Manhattan. Despite his efforts, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/dining/jeremiah-tower-leaves-tavern-on-the-green.html?_r=1">he was out a year later</a>.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="447" data-total-count="1761">Ms. Tenaglia’s camera lends a polished veneer as food authorities like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/ruth-reichl?inline=nyt-per">Ruth Reichl</a>, Mario Batali, Wolfgang Puck and Martha Stewart attest to Mr. Tower’s gifts, with <a href="http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/anthony-bourdain/articles/meet-anthony-bourdain">Anthony Bourdain</a>, one of the film’s producers, especially forceful. Throughout, the solitary Mr. Tower maintains an unflappable refinement, dedicated, a college friend says, to “looking for some utopian possibility of living, because that’s what kept the darkness away.”</p>, <p>

</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="427" data-total-count="427">Because New York City is so ecumenically photogenic, I had high hopes for this documentary about two visionaries with diametrically opposed views of how the city and its residents best live. “Citizen Jane: Battle for the City,” directed by Matt Tyrnauer, which chronicles the author and activist <a class="meta-per" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/jane_jacobs/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Jane Jacobs.">Jane Jacobs</a>’s opposition to several ambitious, potentially ruinous <a class="meta-per" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/robert_moses/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Robert Moses.">Robert Moses</a> projects, is only intermittently stimulating.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="781" data-total-count="1208">The film does not cite the many books that have been written about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/nyregion/robert-moses-andrew-cuomo-and-the-saga-of-a-bronx-expressway.html">Moses</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/books/review/jane-jacobs-eyes-on-the-street-robert-kanigel-vital-little-plans.html">Jacobs</a>, but it does quote extensively from Jacobs’s own groundbreaking 1961 volume, “The Death and Life of Great American Cities.” If you’ve read Robert Caro’s Moses biography, “The Power Broker,” and Anthony Flint’s account of Jacobs’s activism, “Wrestling With Moses,” you know many of the stories eventually retold here. (Mr. Flint is one of the talking heads; Mr. Caro is not.) For the movie’s first half-hour, though, contemporary interviewees repeatedly evoke the views of Moses and Le Corbusier, advocates of a sterile modernism, and contrast them with Jacobs’s advocacy of a more organic mode of urban growth. A long time goes by before any specific project is explored.</p>, <p class="summary">A preview of the film.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="562" data-total-count="1770">The movie lights up whenever it shows archival footage of its antagonists: Jacobs is sensible, warm and witty; Moses is cocksure, occasionally truculent, openly contemptuous of the people his big ideas are likely to displace. Defending a project that would have run Fifth Avenue through Washington Square Park, he sneers at the “cabarets and speakeasies” he plans to raze. Also interesting (and too brief) is a section on the international legacy of Moses: “China today is Moses on steroids,” the political economist Saskia Sassen notes. A scary thought.</p>, <p>

There are kitties — oh, all right; they’re snow leopards, a mother and two cubs. There’s a panda and her cub. There’s a young snub-nosed monkey that, at least in the irksome narrative imposed here, is feeling neglected because of the arrival of a baby sister.</p>, <p class="summary">A preview of the film.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="599" data-total-count="1295">A Tibetan antelope, or chiru, doesn’t get quite the screen time of these others — and isn’t even mentioned in some of the advance publicity for the movie — but footage of a <a href="http://www.earthislandprojects.org/tpp/chirufacts.htm" title="Related web page">long migration</a> by the females of a herd to a calving ground and the arrival of a calf is among the most remarkable in the movie. Maybe that’s just because pandas and even the elusive snow leopard have become overexposed with the abundance of nature documentaries these days; this film looks pretty much like any of the best material to be found on the National Geographic Channel, PBS’s “Nature” and elsewhere.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="1569">In any case, the narrative, read by John Krasinski, is kid-friendly in a cloying sort of way, and unpleasant realities like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/world/asia/china-to-plant-green-necklace-of-trees-around-beijing-to-fight-smog.html?_r=0" title="Related article">China’s pollution</a> are not mentioned. So as an introduction for children to exotic creatures in picturesque landscapes, the movie is harmless enough.</p>, <p>

</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="698" data-total-count="698">In “The Lost City of Z,” a lush, melancholic story of discovery and mystery, a mesmerizing Charlie Hunnam plays a British adventurer in the Amazon who is consumed by “all the glories of exploration,” as Joseph Conrad once wrote of a different journey. Enveloped by the forest, the explorer and his crew face snakes, piranhas, insects and that most terrifying of threats: other people, who at times bombard the strangers with arrows. Undaunted, he perseveres, venturing more deeply into a world that first becomes a passion and then something of a private hallucination. It’s 1906, and while wonders like <a href="http://www.colonialfilm.org.uk/">moving pictures</a> are rapidly shrinking the world, the dream of unknown lands endures.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="670" data-total-count="1368">That dream isn’t only about the Amazon in “The Lost City of Z” but also about the movies and their ability to transport us to astonishing new worlds. For us, the Age of Discovery is long gone and, for the most part, so are old-fashioned historical epics, other than the occasional Chinese extravaganza or one of those international waxworks with clashing accents. Hollywood used to churn these out regularly, but they’ve faded, casualties of shifting industry logic, audience taste, cultural norms and other pressures. The romance of adventure has largely shifted from history to fantasy fiction, an easier, less contested playground for conquering white heroes.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="713" data-total-count="2081">In “The Lost City of Z,” the writer-director James Gray has set out to make a film in the colonial era that suggests the likes of David Lean’s “Lawrence of Arabia,” but through a sensitive, contemporary lens. It’s one that starts from the premise that while white men have long been the keepers of the historical record, they didn’t make the past single-handedly. The story that Mr. Gray has chosen seems an unlikely candidate for such revisionism because it turns on Lieut. Col. Percy Harrison Fawcett, who came to believe in the existence of a lost Amazonian civilization. He called it the lost city of Z; others called it <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/archaeology/el-dorado/">El Dorado</a>, a European illusion that proved catastrophic for the New World.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="735" data-total-count="2816">The movie opens shortly before Fawcett is approached by the Royal Geographical Society to map uncharted territory in Bolivia. A career soldier and son of a disgraced aristocrat, Fawcett is anxious to change his fortunes and increase his social standing. Leaving behind, rather too easily, his loving wife, Nina (Sienna Miller, wonderful), and their young son (later played by Tom Holland), he sets off and is soon struggling through the Amazon with a small crew that includes an aide-de-camp, Henry Costin (an excellent Robert Pattinson, shaggy and almost unrecognizable). Deep in a jungle, where each wonder is matched by terror, Fawcett is ravaged — and then transformed — by his discoveries of both a new world and another self.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="705" data-total-count="3521">Mr. Gray opens this world gloriously. As a director, he has an old-fashioned belief in cinematic beauty, in the charm and necessity of the perfectly lighted and framed face, the hauntingly darkened room, the grittily coarsened street. He’s a sensualist, and in “The Lost City of Z” he turns the Amazon into a ravishment for the senses. (The cinematographer, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/movies/the-cinematography-of-darius-khondji.html">Darius Khondji</a>, who goes dark brilliantly, shot Mr. Gray’s last film, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/movies/the-immigrant-with-joaquin-phoenix-and-marion-cotillard.html" title="a review">The Immigrant</a>.”) As Fawcett presses on, walking and sailing through dense shadow, streaming light and canopies of variegated green, the natural world comes fantastically alive with strange animal cries, stirring trees, roiling fog and frighteningly violent eddies.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="700" data-total-count="4221" id="story-continues-1">In time, native peoples emerge from those trees, by turns watchful, threatening and welcoming. Much as he does throughout his Amazonian travels, Fawcett is enlivened by his encounters with the Indians. He’s a natural, somewhat surprisingly peaceful ambassador given his background and historical moment (even if his restraint also nicely suits Mr. Hunnam’s slow-burning charisma). When his expedition comes under siege at one point, he orders his men not to fire and instead waves a kerchief while calling out “Amigo!” It’s a stratagem, but Fawcett’s curiosity is boundless and he sees accomplishment and complexity in this world, which sharply goes against bigoted orthodoxies back home.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="729" data-total-count="4950" id="story-continues-3">Mr. Gray, working from David Grann’s 2009 <a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/70475/the-lost-city-of-z-by-david-grann/" title="more here">book</a><a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/70475/the-lost-city-of-z-by-david-grann/" title="more here">, </a>“The Lost City of Z,” glosses over Fawcett’s more noxious beliefs. Mr. Grann, for one, writes that Fawcett “escaped virtually every kind of pathology in the jungle, but he could not rid himself of the pernicious disease of race.” It’s no surprise that the real Fawcett was as fascinatingly contradictory as you might expect of a Victorian-born British explorer. Mr. Gray doesn’t soften all of these uncomfortable edges — there is arrogance and tinges of cruelty in this portrait — but he’s far more interested in what seems to have distinguished Fawcett, namely his passionate belief that Amazonian Indians were not the primitives the West insisted they were.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="707" data-total-count="5657">That passion sends Fawcett back to the Amazon several more times over the years, eventually becoming a kind of steadily devouring fever. He’s hailed as a hero after he returns from his first trip, but by the time he’s home he has a new child, whose birth he missed. This sets the template for his life, as Fawcett increasingly gives himself over to the Amazon and neglects his family, a familiar divide that Mr. Gray turns into the story’s axis point. In most movies of this type, the great man kisses the little woman goodbye and sets off. Here, partly because Fawcett repeatedly returns home, Nina emerges as a substantial narrative force and not only a reminder of what he’s willing to sacrifice.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="695" data-total-count="6352">Fawcett finds ecstasy in and out of the Amazon, as does Mr. Gray, who fills the screen with intimate reveries and overwhelming spectacle, including a harrowing interlude during World War I. Until now, Mr. Gray has tended to work on a somewhat modest scale, often with art films that play with genre. Here, he effortlessly expands his reach as he moves across time and continents and in the process turns the past into a singular life. There’s much to love in this film, but what lingers are those lapidary details that often go missing in stories about great men, as if they had built the world alone and no child had ever raced down a road waving goodbye as a father disappeared into history.</p>, <p class="summary">The Times critic Manohla Dargis reviews “The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>

</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="459" data-total-count="459">New England in the mid-19th century was a literary hothouse, overgrown with wild and exotic talents. That <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Belle-Amherst-One-Woman-Play/dp/057363033X">Emily Dickinson</a> was among the most dazzling of these is not disputable, but to say that she was obscure in her own time would exaggerate her celebrity. A handful of her poems appeared in print while she was alive (she died in 1886, at 55), but she preferred private rituals of publication, carefully writing out her verses and sewing them into booklets.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="361" data-total-count="820">Though she had no interest in fame, Dickinson was anything but an amateur scribbler, approaching her craft with unstinting discipline and tackling mighty themes of death, time and eternity. She remains a paradoxical writer: vividly present on the page but at the same time persistently elusive. The more familiar you are with her work, the stranger she becomes.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="500" data-total-count="1320">An admirer can be forgiven for approaching “A Quiet Passion,” Terence Davies’s new movie about Dickinson’s life, with trepidation. The literalness of film and the creaky conventions of the biopic threaten to dissolve that strangeness, to domesticate genius into likable quirkiness. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/movies/terence-davies-interview-sunset-song.html">Mr. Davies</a>, whose work often blends public history and private memory, possesses a poetic sensibility perfectly suited to his subject and a deep, idiosyncratic intuition about what might have made her tick.</p>, <p class="summary">A preview of the film.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="727" data-total-count="2047">To Dickinson — played in the long afternoon of her adult life by <a class="meta-per" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/n/cynthia_nixon/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Cynthia Nixon.">Cynthia Nixon</a> — the enemy of poetry is obviousness. (It is a vice she finds particularly obnoxious in the work of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the reigning poet of the age.) “A Quiet Passion” refuses the obvious at every turn. The romantically disappointed recluse of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Belle-Amherst-One-Woman-Play/dp/057363033X">“The Belle of Amherst,”</a> William Luce’s sturdy, sentimental play, has been replaced by a prickly, funny, freethinking intellectual, whose life is less a chronicle of withdrawal from the world than a series of explosive engagements with the universe. The passion is not so quiet, really. Dickinson muses and ponders, yes, but she also seethes, scolds, teases and bursts out laughing.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="590" data-total-count="2637" id="story-continues-2">Solitude is part of Dickinson’s birthright — the taste for it links her to Henry David Thoreau, another odd duck plying the waters of Massachusetts — but so are social and familial ties. The first time we see young Emily (played by Emma Bell) she is about to be kicked out of Mount Holyoke College, branded a “no-hoper” for her heterodox religious views. The description is wrong, of course. (“Hope is the thing with feathers,” she would write.) Her skepticism about God was more personal than metaphysical. She didn’t doubt his existence so much as question his intentions.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="514" data-total-count="3151" id="story-continues-3">In tracing the flowering of her vocation, Mr. Davies pays scrupulous attention to the milieu that fed it. Her formal education complete, Dickinson returns to Amherst to live with her parents (Keith Carradine and Joanna Bacon); her brother, Austin (Duncan Duff); and her sister, Vinnie (Jennifer Ehle). On the way, there is a trip to a concert with an uptight aunt who is disgusted by the spectacle of a woman singing and disdainful of music in general. What about hymns?, her niece asks. “Hymns are not music.”</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="407" data-total-count="3558">But the Protestant hymnal was the metrical trellis on which Dickinson wreathed blossoms and thorns of musical invention. “A Quiet Passion” suggests that the mixture of austerity and extravagance in her verse was shaped partly by an environment in which religious severity coexisted with aesthetic and intellectual experimentation. (That aunt may have disapproved of the performance, but she still went.)</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="543" data-total-count="4101">This is a visually gorgeous film — full of sunlight and flowers, symmetry and ornament — that also feels refreshingly plain. The smooth, almost lyrical movement of the camera conveys lightness and gravity, much in the way that some of Dickinson’s poems do. Like her voice, it seems to have been set loose in time, to rush forward or to linger as the meaning and the meter require, to turn time itself into a series of riddles. The movie lasts for two hours, or 37 years, or the difference between now and forever, or the span of an idea.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="491" data-total-count="4592">It is dominated by a single voice: Ms. Nixon’s, reciting stanzas instead of voice-over narration and cracking impish, sometimes impious jokes with the marvelous Ms. Ehle. A novel of family life writes itself between the lines, full of memorable characters and dramatic scenes. Parents grow old and die. Austin marries and then has an affair, a transgression that enrages Emily. She and Vinnie seem to exist in precise, kinetic counterpoint, like the left and right hands of a piano étude.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="688" data-total-count="5280">Not everything is harmony. If one of the film’s threads is the existential conundrum that most directly informs Dickinson’s poetry — what it is like to live from moment to moment with the knowledge of eternity — another is the dialectic of freedom and authority that defined her life. Ms. Nixon’s Dickinson is a natural feminist, but she also naturally submits, as her siblings do, to their father’s will. When she wants to write late at night, she asks his permission, noting later that no husband would have granted it. She is submissive and rebellious in ways that defy easy summary. Like the other great American <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/45477">poet</a> of her century, Walt Whitman, she contradicts herself.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="414" data-total-count="5694">And though “A Quiet Passion” is small — modest in scope, inward rather than expansive, precise in word and gesture — it contains multitudes. It opens a window into an era whose political and moral legacies are still with us, and illuminates, with a practiced portraitist’s sureness of touch, the mind of someone who lived completely in her time, knowing all the while that she would eventually escape it.</p>, <p>

</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="699" data-total-count="699">The full, spoilerish title of Joseph Cedar’s new movie — “Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer” — is more or less literally accurate, though it might be argued that “fixer” is a bit euphemistic, if not downright fantastical. In his own mind, Norman Oppenheimer, a well-dressed, well-spoken Manhattanite played with feeling and mischief by <a class="meta-per" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/richard_gere/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Richard Gere">Richard Gere</a>, is what’s known in Yiddish as a macher<em>.</em> He travels the circuits of money and influence, always just a few capillaries removed from the beating heart of power. His mental Rolodex swells with the names of the good and the great, every one of them “a very close friend.” He’d be happy to introduce you.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="461" data-total-count="1160">His alleged friends — financiers, captains of industry, political big shots in Washington and Tel Aviv — might reckon things differently. A rising Israeli politician named Micha Eshel (Lior Ashkenazi) describes Norman to an aide as “a warm Jew.” It’s the nicest thing anyone can say. The aide, an actual fixer named Duby (Yehuda Almagor), has other ideas. In his eyes Norman is, at best, a minor annoyance; at worst, a threat to his patron’s career.</p>, <p class="summary">A preview of the film.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="748" data-total-count="1908">It’s no accident that some of Duby’s words about Norman — “scheming” and “bloodsucking,” in particular — evoke the historical language of anti-Semitism. Mr. Cedar, a New York-born Israeli filmmaker, has a sharp eye for intra-Jewish conflict, for the narcissism of large and small differences that can cause the unity of God’s chosen people to splinter like matzo. His previous film, the sublime academic comedy <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/movies/footnote-a-satire-and-family-drama-by-joseph-cedar.html">“Footnote,”</a> mined father-son rivalry and scholarly antagonism for biblical pathos and borscht belt humor. “Norman” traces fault lines, more cultural and temperamental than ideological or religious, between the members of the diaspora (or at least the New York wing of it) and their cousins in the Promised Land.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="644" data-total-count="2552">One of Mr. Cedar’s slyest conceptual jokes — and one of his boldest provocations at a moment of controversy about race and ethnicity in movie casting — is to place non-Jewish actors in most of the major American Jewish roles. (The Israelis are mostly Israeli, with the exception of Charlotte Gainsbourg, an ethereal embodiment of ethical seriousness and geographical nomadism.) In addition to Mr. Gere (who has never been better), there is Michael Sheen as Norman’s nephew. Steve Buscemi plays a rabbi. It would be a pleasure to write that sentence even if the performance it designates were not a marvel of wit and off-kilter humanity.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="602" data-total-count="3154">Which pretty much describes “Norman” itself. It’s only after the plot has unfolded, with antic elegance and brazen unpredictability, that the risks involved become apparent. The dangers are everywhere: overly broad humor; obnoxiously shticky performances; sentimental tribalism; easy moral point-scoring. None materialize. It’s startling, given how much farce is on display — in the rise-and-fall structure of the narrative; in the madcap scenes of narrowly missed (or fully achieved) catastrophe; in the play of mistaken and forged identities — how much genuine feeling also comes through.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="698" data-total-count="3852" id="story-continues-1">It’s less that Mr. Cedar blends realism with absurdity than that he refuses to acknowledge any distinction between them. Norman, who strides through Midtown in a tweed cap and a camel coat, connected to the world through the earbuds of his iPhone, is an utterly plausible denizen of a city on the move. He is also a nearly mythical figure, a creature sprung from the annals of Jewish literature. You will encounter his ilk — losers, strivers, hucksters and dreamers — in the novels of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/17/the-five-essential-saul-bellow-novels">Saul Bellow</a> and the stories of Franz Kafka and Isaac Bashevis Singer. Also in the films of Mel Brooks and t<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/1.702147">he Coen Brothers</a>. At one point, Norman meets his own double, in the shambolic person of Hank Azaria.</p>, <p class="summary">The Times critic A.O. Scott reviews “Norman."</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="392" data-total-count="4244">Strictly speaking, Norman is a con artist, a spinner of exaggerations, half-truths and outright lies. This may be the source of Micha’s affection for him: This future prime minister can produce his share of seductive rhetorical vapor, and the men also share an evident and endearing insecurity. They want to be liked, to matter not just in public affairs but to the people around them, too.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="4619">And there is something almost selfless in Norman’s hustle. He doesn’t want wealth or power as much as he longs for proximity to them, for entree into a world where important things happen. He calls himself a businessman or a consultant, but he is really running a kind of social pyramid scheme, promising extravagant returns on small investments of kindness and courtesy.</p>, <p>Advertisement</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="4921" id="story-continues-3">He almost succeeds. Or maybe — to give away as little as I can — he does succeed. Only at the very end, with thrilling subtlety and impressive clarity, does a fable blossom from the satirical earth. To put it another way: This is a rare Jewish joke in which the punch line lives up to the delivery.</p>, <p>

</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="335" data-total-count="335">Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/movies/the-death-of-louis-xiv-review.html">“The Death of Louis XIV”</a> comes another candidate for Most Accurately Titled Film of 2017. Tenderhearted readers, fear not; this is neither a documentary nor a live-action depiction. “My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea,” written and directed by Dash Shaw, is an eccentric and lively animated fantasy.</p>, <p class="summary">A preview of the film.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="674" data-total-count="1009">“High School” opens as many high school movies do, with a bus ride. During this one, the dorky hero, Dash (yes, this is one of those films in which the creator is also its vexed but lovable lead character), chats with his best buddy, Assaf (voiced by Reggie Watts), about their work for the school paper, whose editor, Verti (Maya Rudolph), will come between the two. But teenage angst and jealousy are soon to take a back seat to survival after an earthquake pitches the cliffside high school into, yup, the sea. Dash soon finds himself joining forces with the popular girl and a grizzled but resourceful lunch lady to avoid not just sharks but suddenly deadly cliques.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="645" data-total-count="1654">The movie’s flat animation style — Jane Samborski is the lead animator — and purposefully crude character depictions are initially deceptive. (Its personages look as if they’ve been drawn with a Sharpie, in a style reminiscent of Charles M. Schulz and Gary Panter.) As the picture continues, its brightly colored visuals grow ever more psychedelic and phantasmagoric. This makes the mode of narrative and humor — which I’ll call strained, half-curdled, self-regarding millennial whimsy — go down a little easier. The voice work, from a cast that also includes Jason Schwartzman and Lena Dunham, is very good, though not unexpected.</p>, <p>

Set in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the story follows a small caravan of nomads transporting a dying sheikh to his final resting place in the legendary golden city of <a href="http://www.morocco.com/blog/the-ancient-city-of-sijilmasa">Sijilmasa</a>. But when the sheikh dies and two roguish members of the entourage want to bail on their hazardous mission, up pops Shakib (a rivetingly weird Shakib Ben Omar) — armed with a quiverful of faith-based harangues — to urge them to continue.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="1001">We have seen Shakib earlier, in a more modern setting, preaching inexpertly to a crowd of mocking cabdrivers who treat him as some kind of holy fool.

Flying high and wide, he forges belief and fear into a bond with a landscape that doesn’t care whose wishes prevail. The naturalistic sound design agrees, sifting scrabbling stones and rushing water into the thrumming silence of snow and sand. The sum is a movie that panders not at all to Western sensibilities, giving few pointers on a theme beyond the fortifying power of faith. For some viewers, that will be plenty.</p>, <p>

It’s hard not to grin at his huge sculpture, placed outside a stock exchange, of a raised middle finger, or to be awed by his 2011 retrospective, which hung from a truss atop the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/arts/design/maurizio-cattelan-at-the-guggenheim-review.html">Guggenheim’s rotunda</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/arts/design/maurizio-cattelan-at-the-guggenheim-review.html">.</a></p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="1322">When the experts arrive, the fun stalls.

Howell, could easily have made this a movie about those reactions, which seem a little last century; the list of towns where a biracial couple is a novelty is fairly short at this point. Instead, he smartly stays focused on Gina, Mack and Clark, who in different ways are thrown out of their comfort zones by the reception they receive. Countless movies have examined what happens when a country mouse goes to the city; this one shows that leaving a gentrified urban oasis for a small-town world can be just as jolting.</p>, <p>

Video by Jason H. Neubert.</p>, <p>"The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki" is a lovely piece of work, a sweet, warmly observed tale overlaid with just the right amount of Scandinavian melancholy, a combination that perfectly suits its quietly engaging protagonist.</p>, <p>Set in 1962 and inspired by a crucial moment in the life of a real-life Finnish boxer, "Olli Mäki" works wonders with a story that only sounds straight-ahead. Coming out of nowhere, this debut feature by Juho Kuosmanen won the Un Certain Regard prize at Cannes last year with its cinéma vérité-style storytelling and off-center sensibility.</p>, <p>In love with film, the culture of Finland, even love itself, "Olli Maki" benefits from some gorgeous black-and-white cinematography from director of photography Jani-Petteri Passi. Shot on 16mm Tri-X stock that existed in such small amounts that Kodak had to specially produce more, "Olli Mäki" has a crisp yet evocative look filled with so many memorable images that it makes you wish black-and-white was more alive and well as a visual choice.</p>, <p>The heart of a project like this has to be natural acting from its key players, and "Olli Mäki" is so effective in this regard that you soon forget you are not watching real people going about their lives.</p>, <p>The title character, convincingly played both in and out of the ring by Jarkko Lahti, is introduced taking a long trip to his rural home town to see Raija Janka, a young woman he's recently met.</p>, <p>Beautifully played by Oona Airola in her feature debut, Raija is a young woman with an intoxicating smile and a clear sense of herself. Their day together takes some delightful and unexpected turns — in a visually stunning shot, they travel to a wedding with Raija perched on the front of Olli's bicycle — but their growing feeling for each other trumps all, so much so that when Olli goes to Helsinki, Raiji goes along with him.</p>, <p>Though comments about an upcoming bout and questions about Olli's having to drop some pounds to qualify as a featherweight amusingly surface at the wedding, it's only when he is met by his manager, Elis Ask (veteran Finnish actor Eero Milonoff), in Finland's capital that Olli's situation becomes clear.</p>, <p>For this modest man, more at ease with children than adults and someone who literally wouldn't hurt a fly, is just two weeks away from the biggest fight of his career, a title fight with accomplished American fighter Davey Moore, the world champion and later the subject of Bob Dylan’s song “Who Killed Davey Moore.”</p>, <p>Ambitious manager Elis, himself an ex-fighter who has jumped through hoops to bring this fight to Helsinki, understandably wants Olli to focus on his preparations and on losing the pounds he needs to make weight. Which would seem perfectly logical, except that Olli has fallen in love.</p>, <p>Under the best of circumstances Olli, who would rather fly a kite by himself than mingle with the rich and famous, would not be up for the rounds of publicity and meetings with wealthy sponsors that the title fight entails.</p>, <p>But with Raija at least initially close by, Olli's attention is split between what he knows he should be doing to succeed at a craft he loves and has been working at his entire life and what his heart tells him to do.</p>, <p>This dilemma is obviously not an original one, but the treatment it’s given in "Olli Maki" makes it seem like it is. <strong> </strong>The classic melancholy that haunts Olli as the nature of his conflict begins to close in on him ensures that things never get anywhere near overdone.</p>, <p>Most effective of all is the way director Kuosmanen, who co-wrote with Mikko Myllylahti, has created a film that is alive to the pleasures and difficulties of life in a way that constantly surprises us.</p>, <p>Speaking of the unexpected, keep your eye out for an old couple who amble through a scene near this film's end. Yes, it is the real Olli and Raija, walking off the screen and into our hearts.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:kenneth.turan@latimes.com" target="_blank">kenneth.turan@latimes.com</a></strong></p>, <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/KennethTuran" target="_blank">@KennethTuran</a></strong></p>][<p>More than once in “Karl Marx City,” a shrewd personal inquiry into the mass psychology of fear and oppression, documentary filmmaker Petra Epperlein can be seen walking the streets of the former German Democratic Republic, carrying a large microphone. She is recording — as is her cinematographer, co-director and husband, Michael Tucker — but unlike the thousands of civilian informants once employed by the East German Ministry for State Security (a.k.a. the Stasi), she keeps her equipment out in the open, making no secret of her activities.</p>, <p>That’s an important distinction in a film that ingeniously subverts the weaponry of Cold War-era surveillance, employing the tools of the Stasi’s intelligence-gathering operation toward a far more principled end. Whereas the secret police sought to root out and destroy even the slightest hint of subversive activity among a terrified populace, Epperlein and Tucker sift through these illicit materials — and forge their own fresh images and interviews — with an eye toward illuminating the truth and possibly even vindicating the innocent.</p>, <p>That Epperlein herself appears on camera is neither an accident nor a sign of authorial indulgence. She grew up in Chemnitz, a former East German manufacturing town that was once known as Karl-Marx-Stadt, or Karl Marx City. (A 40-ton bronze sculpture of Marx’s head still sits in the middle of the city, an ominous reminder of its Communist legacy and one hell of a Big Brother metaphor.)</p>, <p>It was here that Epperlein’s father hanged himself in 1999, a decade after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Before his suicide, he had received letters threatening to expose him as a former Stasi informant, a charge that doesn’t square with Epperlein’s memory of her father as a thoroughly decent and trustworthy man.</p>, <p>But then, one of the film’s most troubling insights is that countless good men and women (and even children) were pressed and manipulated into service by the Stasi, who were skilled at using even the smallest nuggets of information as weapons of intimidation and control. The documentary continually lays bare the cruelty of a system that turned family members and friends against each other, effectively destroying the most crucial resource — trust — that a society needs to survive.</p>, <p>Shot in evocative black and white, “Karl Marx City” is a sleek, absorbing detective story, a fascinating primer on mass surveillance in the pre-Snowden era, and a roving memoir of East German life. Epperlein returns to her hometown and steers the film down several intriguing alleys, including the curious phenomenon of <em>Ostalgie, </em>or nostalgia for life in  East Germany. One expert coolly dismisses the premise of “The Lives of Others,” Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s Oscar-winning 2006 drama about a Stasi agent who goes rogue to protect the people he’s spying on, as an implausible fabrication.</p>, <p>This isn’t the first time Epperlein and Tucker have sifted through the wreckage of an authoritarian regime, as they did in their 2005 Iraq war documentary, “Gunner Palace,” which followed U.S. troops stationed in what was once Uday Hussein’s pleasure palace. In “Karl Marx City,” Epperlein seeks answers about her father at the former Stasi headquarters in Berlin, diving into an endless labyrinth of shelves that house the files kept on the East German populace (a staggering  69 miles’ worth of material).</p>, <p>In the film’s most fascinating moments, we see some of the grainy black-and-white footage recorded by Stasi informants: shots of friends and neighbors going in and out of buildings, or walking home from the store. The mundanity of the images doesn’t make them any less creepy or unnerving. In her voice-over narration, Epperlein describes the footage as “a kind of documentary truth, an epic of routine,” but it is also a chilling reminder of the banality of evil.</p>, <p>------------</p>, <p><strong>‘Karl Marx City’</strong></p>, <p>No rating</p>, <p>In English and German with English subtitles</p>, <p><strong>Running time:</strong> 1 hour, 29 minutes</p>, <p><strong>Playing:</strong> Laemmle’s Monica Film Center, Santa Monica</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:justin.chang@latimes.com" target="_blank">justin.chang@latimes.com</a></strong></p>, <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/JustinCChang">@JustinCChang</a></strong></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>][<p>If food is your passion, Jeremiah Tower is a name to conjure with. A venerated chef who writer and critic Ruth Reichl calls “a game changer who defined what a modern American restaurant could be,” he was a legend who vanished from the scene only to reappear years later to attempt one more act of culinary magic.</p>, <p>As directed by Lydia Tenaglia and executive produced by Anthony Bourdain — no mean chef himself — “Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent” is a documentary understandably in awe of its subject, a film that finally fascinates despite some initial bumps in the road.</p>, <p>In the 1970s and ’80s Californian Tower was at the pinnacle of the Bay Area restaurant world because of his central role in Berkeley’s Chez Panisse and his founding of Stars in San Francisco. Martha Stewart calls him “a father of American cuisine,” and the many food writers interviewed here can’t help but agree.</p>, <p>Handsome, charismatic, the man who pioneered the concept of the open kitchen and perhaps the first of the modern celebrity chefs, Tower also had so imperious a personality even he has to admit “I seem to piss people off a lot.”</p>, <p>But when “The Last Magnificent” introduces Tower, a craggily handsome individual with something of a haunted look, there is not a restaurant or a set of chef’s whites in sight.</p>, <p>Instead Tower is seen climbing through deserted Mayan ruins (Mexico is where he currently lives) as we hear his voice-over reading gnomic pronouncements from his journals. Things like “I have to stay away from human beings because somehow I am not one,” he intones, followed by, “everything that is real to me is what is hallucination for others.”</p>, <p>So when friends like Bourdain say “there is a locked room inside him, I haven’t been there, I don’t believe anyone has,” it certainly rings true.</p>, <p>It’s the thesis of Tenaglia, whose credits are largely food-related television documentaries, that the key to unlocking that room is to investigate Tower’s childhood. It’s a fine idea, but it proves difficult to convey effectively. Not that Tower isn’t candid about his memories of being a poor little rich kid, taken around the world by wealthy parents with more money than sense who neglected him everywhere they went.</p>, <p>Spending a lot of time in hotels, he became fascinated by their kitchens and claims to have read menus before he read books because they spoke to him in a language of their own.</p>, <p>Aside from a bit of home movie footage, there isn’t a lot to illustrate all these memories, and Tenaglia has made the unwise decision to overindulge in awkward and off-putting re-creations of Tower’s early days. Re-creations have become a pernicious trend in docs, and these are especially lacking.</p>, <p>Fortunately, those pre-restaurant days are soon over and things pick up noticeably once Tower, whose considerable interest in cooking had always been personal, not professional, is hired in 1972 to work in Alice Waters’ recently opened Chez Panisse.</p>, <p>Though much about their tempestuous relationship is a matter of dispute, what all agree on is that the electric culinary collaboration between them was great for Chez Panisse specifically and a new wave of American cooking in general.</p>, <p>In 1976, in Tower’s telling (Waters appears in the film only in archival footage), he wrote the menu for what was to become a legendary dinner to celebrate California cuisine, the first time local ingredients and named farmers were given credit for their role in this kind of a feast.</p>, <p>The rest, obviously, was history, and as the restaurant got grander, with diners flying in on Lear jets, tensions rose and Tower left. The rift between he and Waters widened when the Chez Panisse Menu Cookbook was published in 1982 and Tower felt his contribution was slighted. “I can still feel the outrage,” he says now, and clearly he can.</p>, <p>Tower opened Stars and its pioneering open kitchen in 1984 and took his concept of restaurant as theater to another level. The place hosted everyone from Mikhail Gorbachev to Run DMC and made Tower such a celebrated figure he appeared in a Dewar’s Profile advertisement.</p>, <p>Towers does not talk about the multiple reasons for Stars’ eventual demise, though others do, and the film initially catches up to him living in Merida, rescuing and flipping old houses and cooking delicious meals for himself.</p>, <p>Then, unexpectedly, comes a chance for a last hurrah, the opportunity to take on the traditionally thankless task of being the executive chef of New York's mammoth Tavern on the Green. Can Tower do great food for 700 diners without driving everyone crazy? "The Last Magnificent" takes us behind the scenes for this enigmatic individualist's possible final act.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>###</p>, <p><strong>“Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent”</strong></p>, <p>Rating: R for language.</p>, <p>Running time: 1 hour, 42 minutes.</p>, <p>Playing Landmark, West Los Angeles.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:kenneth.turan@latimes.com" target="_blank">kenneth.turan@latimes.com</a></strong></p>, <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/KennethTuran" target="_blank">@KennethTuran</a></strong></p>][<p>Riots or rebellion? Anarchy or insurrection? Unrest or uprising? Whatever words are used to categorize it, as the 25th anniversary approaches of the frenzy of violence that swept Los Angeles beginning April 29, 1992, attention is being paid. A lot of attention.</p>, <p>No fewer than five documentaries are being broadcast about those events, and no wonder. For one thing, the havoc caused was considerable, with more than 50 people killed, thousands injured and roughly a billion dollars in property damage sustained. Wherever you were in the city, you could see the smoke of a metropolis attacked by flames.</p>, <p>And though a quarter-century is past, the events that began with a notorious acquittal in the trial of four police officers for the beating of <a href="/topic/crime-law-justice/rodney-king-PEOCVC000206-topic.html" id="PEOCVC000206" title="Rodney King">Rodney King</a> are far from settled history. And the societal situations that caused them are no closer to resolution.</p>, <p>Two of those five documentaries are going to have theatrical releases before their TV airings. Though their aesthetic approaches are almost diametrically opposed, the skill with which each has been made enables them to in effect speak to each other. Seen back to back, these two documentaries have a powerful, even explosive impact even though they both cover essentially the same events.</p>, <p>First was the March 3, 1991, traffic stop and savage beating of Rodney King by <a href="/topic/crime-law-justice/law-enforcement/los-angeles-police-department-ORGOV000939-topic.html" id="ORGOV000939" title="Los Angeles Police Department">Los Angeles police</a> officers, followed days later by the fatal shooting of high school student Latasha Harlins by Korean shop owner Soon Ja Du.</p>, <p>Though Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, the judge rejected the jury's recommendation of prison time. Then came the trial of the four LAPD officers indicted in the King beating. They were acquitted, and incendiary crowd reaction at the intersection of Florence and Normandie soon went from bad to worse.</p>, <p>The documentary opening first in theaters — on April 21 for one week at the Laemmle Music Hall in a version that is nearly an hour longer than the one that will be broadcast on <a href="/topic/business/media-industry/television-industry/abc-ORCRP000009600-topic.html" id="ORCRP000009600" title="ABC">ABC</a> on April 28 — is John Ridley's "Let It Fall: Los Angeles 1982-1992."</p>, <p>John Ridley’s eyes narrow as he stands on an undistinguished stretch of Foothill Boulevard in Lake View Terrace, watching intently as traffic whizzes by condo developments near the 210 Freeway and Osborne Street.</p>, <p>The Oscar-winning screenwriter (“12 Years a Slave”) and creator of racially charged...</p>, <p>John Ridley’s eyes narrow as he stands on an undistinguished stretch of Foothill Boulevard in Lake View Terrace, watching intently as traffic whizzes by condo developments near the 210 Freeway and Osborne Street.</p>, <p>The Oscar-winning screenwriter (“12 Years a Slave”) and creator of racially charged...</p>, <p>Though it has its share of excellent footage from back in the day, the strength of "Let It Fall" is in its remarkable contemporary interviews, compelling both for the people recorded and the way the conversations are allowed to unfold.</p>, <p>"LA 92," at the Laemmle Noho on April 28, two days before it is broadcast on the National Geographic Channel, takes the opposite tack. Directed by Dan Lindsay and TJ Martin, who won an Oscar for "Undefeated," "LA 92" intentionally avoids interviews and constructs a narrative entirely through immersion in archival footage.</p>, <p>The fact that "Let It Fall" takes a deep dive into its interviews is no surprise, and not just because a team of veteran ABC folks, starting with producer Jeanmarie Condon, were involved. Ridley's previous writing credits, including  "12 Years A Slave" (for which he won an Oscar) and ABC's "American Crime," point in that direction as well.</p>, <p>Understanding that the past is prologue, both documentaries, like the Oscar-winning "O.J.: Made In America," go back years before Rodney King. "Let It Fall" begins 10 years earlier, with the chokehold death of James Mincey Jr. that led to policies that had an effect on the King beating. Spoken to at length, for instance, are Mincey's girlfriend at the time and an LAPD officer who was part of the Mincey arrest team.</p>, <p>The list of involved and involving people "Let It Fall" has persuaded to talk on camera is considerable, including Terry White, the deputy district attorney who prosecuted the King beaters; Lakeshia Combs, an eyewitness to the Latasha Harlins killing; Henry King, a Rodney King juror who for years hid his multiracial past, and Bobby Green, who says God instructed him to go to Florence and Normandie and save the life of badly beaten truck driver Reginald Denny.</p>, <p>One of the film's most significant interviews is with former LAPD Lt. Michael Moulin, who passionately defends his controversial decision to pull police back from an early altercation in the Florence/Normandie area.</p>, <p>"Let It Fall" understands the value of allowing its interview subjects to talk at greater, more involving length than is usual for documentaries, a technique that illuminates the complexities of reality and gives listeners a sense of the emotional textures of these people's lives.</p>, <p>If "Let It Fall" begins 10 years before Rodney King, "LA 92" goes back even further, to the violence of Watts in 1965, in itself a huge and significant event.</p>, <p>By sifting through and tying together an enormous variety of footage, directors Lindsay &amp; Martin (who also served as editor) create an experience that gives a full sense of the anarchy and rage of the post-King verdict days, thrusting us fully and disturbingly into events in very much of a You Are There manner.</p>, <p>Among the more memorable clips show the victims of the beatings and, later, of the arson: a Korean woman recoiling from her burned store as if physically assaulted, another repeating,  "this is not fair, this is not fair," an African American arson victim close to tears, saying, "I come from the ghetto, that's not right."</p>, <p>Perhaps the quote that has the most impact, however, is one of the earliest, a passage from 1965's McCone Commission postmortem on what happened in Watts.</p>, <p>"What shall it avail our nation if we can put a man on the moon but cannot cure the sickness of our cities?"</p>, <p>It was a potent question then and, as these two fine documentaries demonstrate, it remains one today.</p>, <p>-------------</p>, <p><strong>‘Let It Fall: Los Angeles 1982-1992’</strong></p>, <p>Not rated</p>, <p><strong>Running time:</strong> 2 hours, 25 minutes</p>, <p><strong>Playing:</strong> Starts April 21, Laemmle Music Hall, Beverly Hills</p>, <p><strong>Also airing:</strong> Friday, April 28 on ABC at 9 p.m.</p>, <p>-------------</p>, <p><strong>‘LA 92’</strong></p>, <p>Not rated</p>, <p><strong>Running time:</strong> 1 hour, 54 minutes</p>, <p><strong>Playing:</strong> Starts April 28, Laemmle NoHo 7, North Hollywood</p>, <p><strong>Also airing:</strong> Sunday, April 30 on National Geographic at 9 p.m.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:kenneth.turan@latimes.com" target="_blank">kenneth.turan@latimes.com</a></strong></p>, <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/KennethTuran" target="_blank">@KennethTuran</a></strong></p>, <p><strong><strong>ALSO</strong></strong></p>, <p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-john-ridley-abc-documentary-20161217-story.html?14926910581898" target="_blank">What it took for Oscar winner John Ridley get the story of the 1992 Los Angeles riots to screen</a></strong></strong></p>][<p>Set in late-’70s Boston, the ferocious, funny and relentless “Free Fire” places a group of shady characters in a deserted warehouse for the sale of a few cases of machine guns. A personal dispute between two of the least important people in the deal, guys just there to move boxes, quickly escalates from yelling to fists to handguns to everyone there in a full-fledged shootout.</p>, <p>Once the shooting starts, the movie becomes a nostop battle. Amid the  chaos, eventually one low-level hoodlum yells out that he can’t remember which side he’s on. </p>, <p>“Free Fire” is directed by Ben Wheatley, who co-wrote and edited the film with his wife, Amy Jump. The  partnership between the two British filmmakers, who most recently gave us “High-Rise,” may be among the most exhilarating and genuinely collaborative in contemporary movies.</p>, <p>Their work  has torn fearlessly through genres, combining a fan’s enthusiasm with a connoisseur’s eye. Following  the disorienting gut-punches of “Kill List,” the road trip serial killer rom-com of “Sightseers,” the psychedelic historical simplicity of “A Field in England” and the sprawling dystopian satire of “High-Rise,” “Free Fire” is a savagely funny and viciously precise distillation of one of the pair’s favorite themes: </p>, <p>Men are idiots.</p>, <p>This is not a novel notion, but “Free Fire” sets out the ways  men can trip over themselves, from outright ego, lazy obliviousness, posturing projection, deluding rationalizations and on down the line. In smartly examining the foibles and fragility of the male psyche, Wheatley and Jump also make the case for self-awareness and understanding. </p>, <p>The cast members attack their roles with palpable glee, a sense of enthusiastic exaggeration to match the outrageous goings-on. Michael Smiley and Cillian Murphy play IRA operatives  who are the closest the film comes to having heroes; they just want to get the deal done and move on. <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/sharlto-copley-PECLB0000005277-topic.html" id="PECLB0000005277" title="Sharlto Copley">Sharlto Copley</a> relishes the eccentricities of his blowhard half-cracked crime lord while Sam Riley, Noah Taylor, <a href="/topic/entertainment/jack-reynor-PECLB0015435-topic.html" id="PECLB0015435" title="Jack Reynor">Jack Reynor</a>, Babou Ceesay and Enzo Cilenti make the most of it as they are caught in the crossire.</p>, <p>Brie Larson and <a href="/topic/entertainment/armie-hammer-PECLB0000005461-topic.html" id="PECLB0000005461" title="Armie Hammer">Armie Hammer</a>  play fixers with no real stake in things. She becomes the glue holding it all together, and her performance unveils something thorny and dangerous beneath a placidly positive exterior. Asked if she’s with the FBI, her character Justine responds with the film’s signature line, “I’m IIFM — In it for Myself.”</p>, <p>Given the chaotic nature of the action, it’s a minor marvel that Wheatley, working with regular cinematographer Laurie Rose keeps the geography of the room and the location of each shooter consistently clear even as the action resets itself again and again, shifting dynamics, geography and allegiances depending on who can take aim at whom.  It helps that once everyone has suffered minor wounds they can’t move too fast; chase scenes played out at a crawl’s pace become a, er, running gag.</p>, <p>“Free Fire” is executive produced by <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/martin-scorsese-PECLB004197-topic.html" id="PECLB004197" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> and his recent producer Emma Tillinger Koskoff, and the late-’70s Boston setting makes the new movie something of a parenthetical aside to Scorsese’s own “The Departed.” Wheatley’s film certainly could be seen as a shaggy dog shoot-’em-up fable that one cheap crook might tell to another while killing time.</p>, <p> “Free Fire” is not  Wheatley’s best film, but it is a rollicking good time and, more important, an inadvertent skeleton key to thinking about and understanding the rest of his films.

Smart and too perceptive for his own good, he spends his lonely days and nights in the comfort of his VHS collection of vampire movies, poring over modern bloodsucking classics like “Thirst,” “Fright Night” and “Near Dark.”</p>, <p>Unlike most teenage boys navigating the usual existential angst of young adulthood, Milo doesn’t watch vampire flicks for kicks: He’s also studying them for “hunting” tricks, rules to avoid detection and capture and, perhaps, clues to the deep, desperate need that occasionally drives him to slip out of his apartment into the shadowy streets of Manhattan in search of his own victims.</p>, <p>Bold and brutal in shocking spurts, the indie horror drama from writer-director O’Shea is a startling debut that leaves a fresh mark on the genre while celebrating its forbears. “The Transfiguration’s” embrace of its own vampiric influences run so deep that low-budget schlock king Lloyd Kaufman and NYC DIY cinema stalwart Larry Fessenden (“Habit”) turn up in cameos as unlucky victims of Milo’s nighttime stalking, their blood literally feeding the hunger of a younger generation.</p>, <p>Milo’s routine — go to class, evade the questions of a concerned school counselor, watch more movies, find more victims—– is interrupted with the arrival of Sophie (Chloe Levine), a slightly older girl with self-destructive tendencies of her own who moves into the building with her abusive grandfather. He fights the urge to kill her and drink her blood, the surest sign of true love, or the closest thing to it he can muster.</p>, <p>They wander the city, trading starkly different perspectives on what makes a good vampire movie, and find unexpected solace in one another, two unmoored kids in a big, unforgiving world.</p>, <p>The sparkly vampires of “Twilight” do it for Sophie, but the emotionally paralyzed Milo has only one standard for vampire movies: Realism. He recommends “Let the Right One In,” the 2008 Swedish coming-of-age vampire flick about a bullied kid who falls for a vampire, and George A. Romero’s 1978 vampire tragedy “Martin” — the movies from which O’Shea’s script most heavily, and openly, borrows.</p>, <p>By setting “The Transfiguration” in the inner city of contemporary America — and making his protagonist young, black, male and adrift in a system primed to neglect him — O’Shea creates a film far more brutal and bleak than either of those spiritual and textual predecessors.</p>, <p>Whether or not Milo really must feed on human blood is left tantalizingly open-ended. The real questions surrounding what drew him to vampire lore in the first place cut directly into the mournful human yearnings that roil inside him, unable to find expression or release.</p>, <p>Shot perceptively by Sung Rae Cho across a concrete but vibrant New York City landscape and largely filmed “live” in uncontrolled locations with just a skeleton crew and the film’s young actors, the slow-simmering tale brims with an abundance of space — physical space that engulfs Ruffin’s diminutive Milo in increasingly isolating tableaux, and emotional space that pays off with surprisingly tragic poignancy in the film’s final act.</p>, <p>Brutally unflinching and melancholic, the film brings Milo’s affliction full circle as it reveals the source of his bloody fixation. It achieves a transcendent note as it lays out the grand plan he’s been orchestrating all along to find peace not only for himself but for the people he loves — requiem for the tortured vampires of stories past and for all those who find solace in their struggle.</p>, <p>----------</p>, <p><strong>‘The Transfiguration’</strong></p>, <p>Not rated</p>, <p><strong>Running time:</strong> 1 hour, 37 minutes</p>, <p><strong>Playing:</strong> Landmark Nuart, West L.A.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:jen.yamato@latimes.com" target="_blank">jen.yamato@latimes.com</a></strong></p>, <p><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/jenyamato" target="_blank">@jenyamato</a></strong></p>][<p>Every once in a while, you need a good, juicy, erotic thriller. In the ’90s, they were plentiful, but now they're rare (forget the dopey “50 Shades” movies), which makes savoring the outlandishly entertaining “Unforgettable” worthwhile. It's a female-driven melodrama — a “women's picture” as they used to call them in the Hollywood of the 1940s — that deals frankly with the issues of domestic violence, trauma and motherhood, all wrapped up in a salacious and often deliciously campy package.</p>, <p>Veteran producer Denise Di Novi makes “Unforgettable” her directorial debut, working with a script by Christina Hodson. Di Novi crafts a well-executed thriller that somehow balances these very sobering problems with the more over-the-top elements, thanks in large part to her lead actresses. Rosario Dawson plays the down-to-earth Julia, the film’s voice of reason. She's a domestic violence survivor who moves to Southern California from San Francisco to be with her new fiance, David (Geoff Stults).</p>, <p>On the other side of the spectrum is an amazing <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/katherine-heigl-PECLB005351-topic.html" id="PECLB005351" title="Katherine Heigl">Katherine Heigl</a>, making a triumphant comeback as David's terrifyingly Stepford-esque ex-wife, Tessa. Heigl is all power pumps and stick-straight hair as the Type-A Tessa, wound so tightly you know some screw is about to come loose — if it hasn't already. Her arch performance as this rattlesnake of a woman, coiled and ready to spring for attack, is revelatory. She's the villain Heigl was always supposed to play.</p>, <p>Tessa and David have to navigate shared custody of their daughter, Lily (Isabella Kai Rice), which puts Tessa front and center in Julia and David's dreamy new relationship. All it takes is one hair tangle, a glimpse at the happy new blended family and a text about a wedding dress to send Tessa violently spiraling. She turns into an Internet-stalking, catfishing burglar, dredging up Julia's messy past to come back and haunt her.</p>, <p>“Unforgettable” is tawdry, sometimes cheesy and definitely soapy. There are some insane choices made in the production design, which is perfect for a movie like this. It'd be all too easy to write it off as “guilty-pleasure” material, a higher-budget Lifetime movie. But that would denigrate female-driven entertainment that deals with the melodramas of the mind, body and soul from a woman's perspective. Though this movie has its outrageous moments, Di Novi puts the female emotional journey up front and treats things respectfully.</p>, <p>But every erotic thriller needs some crazy, and thank goodness for Heigl's full commitment to her character's insanity. That campiness is needed in a picture like this, allowing the audience relief from the tension while we giggle at her enthusiastic hair brushing or wild-eyed mania. In a final scene, she's swathed gloriously in a mint caftan, her hair flowing. She calls to mind that other unforgettably controlling mother, Margaret White, from <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/brian-de-palma-PECLB004061-topic.html" id="PECLB004061" title="Brian De Palma">Brian De Palma</a>'s 1976 film, “Carrie,” played by Piper Laurie, who earned an Oscar nomination for that role. Heigl channels Laurie's performance with her lilting tones and soft savagery. It's a uniquely feminine kind of villainy, and Di Novi and Heigl understand it implicitly in order to execute it perfectly.</p>, <p>-------------</p>, <p><strong>‘Unforgettable'</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rating:</strong> R for sexual content, violence, some language, and brief partial nudity</p>, <p><strong>Running time:</strong> 1 hour, 40 minutes</p>, <p><strong>Playing:</strong> In general release</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:calendar@latimes.com" target="_blank">calendar@latimes.com</a></strong></p>][<p>History is rife with horrific events that somehow manage to reveal  true humanity and heroism. Many of these events are underreported, underrepresented and misunderstood, such as the Armenian genocide — the extermination of 1.5 million Armenians and other ethnic and religious minorities by the Ottoman Empire, starting in 1915.</p>, <p>Knowledge of this genocide isn't universal, and Turkey, the successor nation of the Ottoman Empire, still refuses to acknowledge it. The epic melodrama “The Promise,” based on these events, seeks to remedy popular understanding of the horror. It's a noble undertaking that only partially succeeds.</p>, <p>Written by Robin Swicord and director Terry George, “The Promise” has all the trappings of a romantic epic — movie stars, love triangles, exotic destinations. It boasts Oscar Isaac, <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/christian-bale-PECLB000324-topic.html" id="PECLB000324" title="Christian Bale">Christian Bale</a> and gorgeous European locations, plus experienced talent behind the camera, so it's confounding then that “The Promise” falls so flat.</p>, <p>The film is a color-by-numbers wartime drama. Isaac plays Mikael, a young medical student from a small Armenian village, pursuing his fortune in Constantinople. There he befriends a young Turk (Marwan Kenzari) and an American reporter (Bale) and falls in love with a worldly and well-traveled Armenian woman, Ana (Charlotte Le Bon), though he's promised to a young woman back home. When the Ottomans enter World War I, the group is torn apart by hatred, racism and violence.</p>, <p>At least, that's what we can glean from the events depicted onscreen. Throughout its two-hour plus running time, there is nary an explanation of the political machinations behind the persecution of the Armenians. There's a bit of chit-chat and singing with some German soldiers, a mean Turkish father, and then suddenly everyone's being executed and shipped off to labor camps while villages burn.</p>, <p>The lack of exposition could be intended to align us with Mikael's naive perspective. But you'll definitely leave “The Promise” with far more questions than you started. Perhaps we can never really answer why one group commits genocide against another, but it feels slightly irresponsible to make a film ostensibly shedding light on this atrocity and then not attempt to explain it in the least.</p>, <p>Instead, “The Promise” is mostly concerned with the love triangle between Ana, Mikael and Chris, the reporter. And even the love triangle itself is a disappointment, as these men never seem too concerned that the other is romancing his girl.</p>, <p>The usually charismatic Isaac is saddled with a dud of a character. Mikael spends most of the film buffeted by forces beyond his control and deferring to the desires of others, such as the army and his mother (Shohreh Aghdashloo). It's not until the third act that he starts to make his own decisions. The swaggering heroics are left to Bale as the Hemingway-esque American foreign correspondent.</p>, <p>With seemingly all the right pieces, it's a disappointment that “The Promise” lacks the energy and originality needed to sustain itself. It might be fresh material, but the approach is decidedly stale.</p>, <p><em>Katie Walsh is a Tribune News Service film critic.</em></p>, <p>-------------</p>, <p><strong>‘The Promise'</strong></p>, <p><strong>Running time:</strong> 2 hours 12 minutes</p>, <p><strong>Rating:</strong> PG-13, for thematic material including war atrocities, violence and disturbing images, and for some sexuality</p>, <p><strong>Playing:</strong> In general release</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:calendar@latimes.com" target="_blank">calendar@latimes.com</a></strong></p>][<p>“Born in China” is the latest installment in the Disneynature documentary series. It’s “Planet Earth” aimed at younger audiences, but any nature lover can find enjoyment here, especially in the stunning cinematography.</p>, <p>While other installments have focused on specific species and ecosystems, “Born in China,” directed by Lu Chuan, gets up close and personal with species unique to China — pandas, snow leopards, cranes, Chiru antelope and golden monkeys. Chuan’s team follows these incredible animals across the seasons and throughout the circle of life while incorporating Chinese spiritual beliefs about life and death.</p>, <p>John Krasinski narrates, and though he doesn’t achieve that mix of gravitas and cheeky wit that Sir David Attenborough brought to the classic nature series “Life on Earth” and “Planet Earth” his vocal stylings are perfectly homey and serviceable for the task of guiding us through the lives of these special animals.</p>, <p>The footage captured is breathtaking for its access and intimacy. A few outtakes during the credits offer a look inside the production process, which involves both stationary hidden cameras attached to rocks and the like, as well as production crews trekking into the wilderness in pursuit of images. The small taste of behind-the-scenes information is so fascinating that you almost want to watch an entire documentary just about this process.</p>, <p>The drama captured in “Born in China” is remarkable, from a territorial snow leopard standoff to the first steps of a baby panda and the antics of a group of young golden monkeys — though it’s clear that some of these interactions have been coaxed by creative filmmakers for maximum narrative enjoyment. The editors weave stories worthy of any Disney classic — Tao Tao the golden monkey is shunned by his family after the arrival of his baby sister, and his peers, the Lost Boys, don’t offer much solace either. Dawa the snow leopard hunts ferociously to provide for her cubs, but is it enough? Ya Ya the panda carefully guides her baby, Mei Mei, through the process of growing up.</p>, <p>As deliciously cute and cuddly as Mei Mei and Ya Ya are, the breakout stars are definitely the golden monkeys. These curious creatures sport bright marigold fur and bluish-gray faces with huge expressive eyes.

A message before the screening announced that seeing the film opening weekend would help raise funds for saving these animals.

From watching the film, one wouldn’t know if these animals were endangered or threatened by man-made development, predators or climate change.

of its first half detailing the complex forces that led to this horrific event.  These include Guatemala’s 36-year civil war, which began in 1960; the right-wing coup that made Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt the country’s de facto president (he served from 1982 to 1983), and then-U.S. President Reagan’s support for Ríos Montt.</p>, <p>But it’s the discovery, almost two decades after the Dos Erres genocide, that two young boys — Oscar Ramírez and Ramiro Cristales — had been abducted and raised by the very soldiers who had killed their families that moves the narrative into more personal and emotional territory.</p>, <p>A search ensues for Cristales (now living in Winnipeg, Canada) and, more dramatically, Ramírez, who had moved to Massachusetts in 2005 with wife Nidia.

Video by Jason H. Neubert.</p>, <p>In May 1925, the legendary British explorer, surveyor and archaeologist Lt. Col. Percy Fawcett vanished, along with his son Jack and their friend Raleigh Rimmell, while searching for the ruins of an ancient South American civilization. It was Fawcett’s eighth expedition to the Amazon, and it’s the third one we see dramatized in “The Lost City of Z,” James Gray’s rich, meditative and deeply transporting portrait of a man who found himself compelled to enter the jungle again and again, even if it meant leaving behind his family and defying the expectations and assumptions of those who sent him.</p>, <p>“A man’s reach should exceed his grasp,” Fawcett notes, and so, perhaps, should the reach of any filmmaker trying to get a handle on this particular mystery. And Gray, a shrewd and soulful Hollywood classicist, has duly allowed Fawcett’s obsession to fuel his own. In hacking his way through the tangled narrative undergrowth of David Grann’s nonfiction bestseller, and transforming the Amazon’s legendary “green hell” into a heavenly celluloid vision, the director evinces the kind of faith in the power of cinema that once led masters like <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/francis-ford-coppola-PECLB001133-topic.html" id="PECLB001133" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a> and Werner Herzog into their own storied episodes of downriver madness.</p>, <p>Among other things, that faith has compelled Gray to leave his native New York, an urban jungle that he has spent most of his career colonizing, starting with his 1994 Brighton Beach-set crime thriller, “Little Odessa,” and culminating in his epic Ellis Island melodrama, “The Immigrant” (2013). If that film’s ambitious period re-creation and elegiac sense of tragedy pointed the way toward “The Lost City of Z,” it’s still remarkable how boldly Gray approaches two new and equally distant early 20th century frontiers here, stretching from the upper echelons of British society to the uncharted reaches of the South American wilderness.</p>, <p>Fawcett, for his part, seems to have felt much more at home in the latter. He is played by <a href="/topic/entertainment/charlie-hunnam-PECLB0000005888-topic.html" id="PECLB0000005888" title="Charlie Hunnam">Charlie Hunnam</a> (“Sons of Anarchy”), who, despite his handsome blond features and athletic build, projects little in the way of a golden boy’s arrogance. When we first meet Fawcett in 1905, he is an undecorated British army major stationed in Cork, Ireland, eager to distinguish himself and erase the damaging legacy of his father’s dissolute ways.</p>, <p>An assignment from the Royal Geographical Society of London — a two-year mapmaking expedition along the much-disputed border of Bolivia and Brazil — does not quite promise the glorious destiny he has in mind. But across the Atlantic, into the jungle and down the Amazon he goes, leaving behind his pregnant wife, Nina (Sienna Miller), and their young son, Jack, and plunging into a world where deadly diseases, sharp-toothed predators and wary tribespeople lie in wait for him and his comrades, Henry Costin (<a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/robert-pattinson-PECLB0004408-topic.html" id="PECLB0004408" title="Robert Pattinson">Robert Pattinson</a>) and Arthur Manley (Edward Ashley).</p>, <p>But the jungle’s natural wonders and horrors are not what seem to interest Gray most. Notwithstanding a snake, a panther and a bloodthirsty school of piranhas, the director has largely cut back on Grann’s endlessly detailed panoply of creepy-crawlies without in any way derailing the viewer’s sense of wonderment. Shooting on 35-millimeter film (as he did with “The Immigrant”), the cinematographer Darius Khondji duly honors the intoxicating beauty of this humid emerald forest in luminously textured images that seem to beckon us as surely as they must have beckoned Fawcett.</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Amid the gathering mists, the dense foliage and the immersive soundscape, which occasionally merges with the restrained swells of Christopher Spelman’s score, you might glean the flickering specters of great movies past. A jaw-droppingly surreal interlude in which Fawcett stumbles on an opera house in a clearing nods to “Fitzcarraldo,” while a sudden ambush signaled by a deadly rain of arrows is scarcely Gray’s sole invocation of “Apocalypse Now.”</p>, <p>It is here too that Fawcett uncovers his first clues — hand-sculpted artifacts, whispers among the indigenous people he encounters — that this jungle may hold the remnants of a lost civilization. This fabled El Dorado looms ever larger in Fawcett’s imagination when he returns to London and tries to persuade his fellow society members of a city that may predate Western civilization — an idea that Gray dramatizes, in a terrifically raucous sequence, as an affront to the cultural arrogance of the British Empire.</p>, <p>The discoveries that fascinate Gray here are not strictly anthropological, and his sense of the world as a teeming jungle, cruel and merciless and indifferent to human survival, does not begin and end with the Amazon. He shows us the essential hypocrisy of a civilization in which human beings can be subjected to rigid yet arbitrary class divisions one minute, then tossed into the great, bloody equalizer of World War I the next — as we see when Fawcett, Costin and Manley find themselves caught up in the 1916 Battle of the Somme, whose horrifying brutality the film evokes with extraordinary vividness and restraint.</p>, <p>In the face of these atrocities, it makes a strange kind of sense that Fawcett might feel more at home in the company of a cannibal tribe he encounters on a 1912 expedition back to the Amazon. “We must attempt to engage,” he tells his fellow explorers, none more quietly loyal than Costin, whom the thickly bearded Pattinson plays with wry, witty understatement. Costin stands in stark contrast to the cowardly and treacherous James Murray (a supremely loathsome Angus Macfadyen), a fellow society traveler who will prove to be a thorn in Fawcett’s side even after they return home.</p>, <p>For all its lush, golden-hued classicism, which might seem to invite the temptations of nostalgia, “The Lost City of Z” attacks the era’s colonialist attitudes with a critical and bracingly modern spirit. Fawcett doesn’t approach the “savages” as a white savior or superior; he shows them the same respect (perhaps more) that he accords his own peers, reserving his contempt instead for the rubber-producing industry that has decimated their region.</p>, <p>If this Fawcett is a model of enlightenment in many ways, he remains very much a man of his moment in others. Some of the picture’s most gripping moments reveal the personal toll of his long absences from home, including one scene in which Nina — played by Miller in one of her sharpest performances — gives angry voice to the realization that her own adventurous and independent spirit has no outlet in this patriarchal world. Fawcett’s complicated relationship with Jack (played as a teenager by Tom Holland) is no less beautifully realized, and their initial estrangement finds moving reconciliation in the vast adventure that awaits and unites them at movie’s end.</p>, <p>Most actors who dine in West Hollywood delis don't talk to beret-clad strangers.‎</p>, <p>And they're especially not likely to be listening to one of those strangers deliver disquisitions about wine. ‎</p>, <p>Yet, improbably, there is <a href="/topic/entertainment/charlie-hunnam-PECLB0000005888-topic.html">Charlie Hunnam</a> — snappily dressed Brit, gritty-as-dirt Jax from “Sons of Anarchy”...</p>, <p>Most actors who dine in West Hollywood delis don't talk to beret-clad strangers.‎</p>, <p>And they're especially not likely to be listening to one of those strangers deliver disquisitions about wine. ‎</p>, <p>Yet, improbably, there is <a href="/topic/entertainment/charlie-hunnam-PECLB0000005888-topic.html">Charlie Hunnam</a> — snappily dressed Brit, gritty-as-dirt Jax from “Sons of Anarchy”...</p>, <p>Hunnam was cast as Fawcett after Brad Pitt (one of the film’s executive producers) and Benedict Cumberbatch bowed out, and that inevitable sense of having something to prove can only have helped; this is easily his finest and most disciplined film performance. His Fawcett might have benefited from a touch more madness, a more consuming sense of obsession, but you feel it blazing within him nonetheless, inseparable from the keen intelligence and tremendous physical fortitude that made him such an exemplary explorer.</p>, <p>“The Lost City of Z” is the kind of picture whose classicism, a term often confused with conventionality, feels increasingly like a radical statement of intent. Fawcett’s journeys into the Amazon, each one drawing him a little further into his heart of darkness, provide the film with a steady rhythm and a clean three-act structure, but its hauntingly lyrical final scenes deliver the very opposite of closure. The movie may, in the end, frustrate your desire for straight-up thrills and clear answers, but its irresolution is masterful — sincere, generous and entirely appropriate to the deeply searching story it has to tell.</p>, <p>Fawcett has become a near-mythic avatar of obsessive wanderlust; his travels inspired great writers including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Evelyn Waugh, and he is purported to be a chief inspiration for Indiana Jones. In the decades following his disappearance, numerous explorer-disciples attempted to retrace his steps, and many paid for the attempt with their own lives. Gray offers up his own poetic speculation, but he doesn’t pretend to know any of the answers they sought.

Video by Jason H. Neubert.</p>, <p>Subtle, unsettling, slyly amusing, "Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer" takes some getting used to because it's the kind of film we're not used to seeing.</p>, <p>Starring an unexpectedly persuasive Richard Gere and the first English-language film from top Israeli filmmaker Joseph Cedar, this delicate, novelistic character study is what more American independent films would be like if more were made by thoughtful grown-ups who gravitated toward nuance and complexity.</p>, <p>The gifted Cedar, a writer-director whose last two works, "Beaufort" and "Footnote," were Oscar nominated, never makes the same film twice. Here he's come up with an entirely involving drama about means and ends, illusion and delusion and the price having your dreams come true can extract, all of it centering on a man named Norman.</p>, <p>Norman's last name, Oppenheimer, is Cedar's acknowledged tribute to Joseph Suss Oppenheimer, an influential and ill-fated 18th century "court Jew" who was a banker and behind-the-scenes mover and shaker for a powerful German duke.</p>, <p>Impeccably played by Gere, who has completely immersed himself in a very unlikely role, this Oppenheimer starts out without even a thimbleful of money or influence. A pusher, a hustler, an eternal searcher for the exploitable angle, Norman has nothing to go on but his drive.</p>, <p>In a wise but unorthodox move, Cedar doesn't try to explain or psychoanalyze Norman, doesn't provide his back story or reveal his secrets, doesn't even tell us where Norman lives or whether his claims of family beyond his nephew Philip (the protean Michael Sheen) are true or not. It simply presents his actions in their confounding single-mindedness.</p>, <p>Always dressed in the same camel-hair topcoat and gray flat cap over a serviceable black suit, a bag slung across his body and phone earplugs at the ready, Norman is a one-man army.</p>, <p>Constantly walking and talking on the streets of Manhattan, unless he's taking a herring-and-crackers break at a synagogue run by trusting Rabbi Blumenthal (an unexpected <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/steve-buscemi-PECLB000768-topic.html" id="PECLB000768" title="Steve Buscemi">Steve Buscemi</a>), Norman is fighting to promote himself at all costs. Told he's like "a drowning man trying to wave at an ocean liner," he insists "but I'm a good swimmer."</p>, <p>When "Norman" opens, the details of the project he is seen promoting are not clear, but there's never any doubt of the ferocity with which he's pushing it.</p>, <p>Searching for a way to connect with powerful financier Arthur Taub (Josh Charles), Norman button-holes people wherever he finds them, exaggerating and insinuating, trafficking in half-truths, evasions, prevarications and even outright lies.</p>, <p>Absolutely impervious to rejection, unfazed by blows that would stun a bull elephant, Norman keeps going not only because that's who he is but also because he truly believes his middle-man talents are providing a service by connecting those whom only he can help.</p>, <p>Norman's search for potential Taub leverage leads him to the visiting Micha Eshel, Israel’s obscure but ambitious deputy minister of Industry, Trade and Labor beautifully played by Lior Ashkenazi (the younger Talmudic scholar in Cedar's brilliant "Footnote.")</p>, <p>Inveigling his way into conversation with Eshel in front of a high-end Manhattan shoe boutique run by the ethereal Jacques (a wonderful cameo by Isaach De Bankole), Norman ends up spending $1,192, tax included, buying the Israeli what he calls "the most expensive pair of shoes in New York." It's a purchase that will change his life.</p>, <p>For, three years and numerous favors later, a miracle happens. Obscure no more, Eshel becomes prime minister and anoints Norman his "unofficial ambassador to New York Jewry," leading to some sublime scenes illustrating with cinematic elan what it feels like to have doors previously closed swinging open.</p>, <p>Those open doors, as it turns out, don't only offer opportunity, they let in a host of problems Norman never had before, as people expect more from him and it becomes trickier than ever for him to deliver.</p>, <p>In addition to Gere and the other stars, Cedar has made excellent use of fine actors like Charlotte Gainsbourg, Dan Stevens, <a href="/topic/entertainment/hank-azaria-PECLB000287-topic.html" id="PECLB000287" title="Hank Azaria">Hank Azaria</a> and Harris Yulin in supporting roles and in general dazzles us with his great command of his complex story.</p>, <p>As "Norman" hurtles toward its daring and unexpected conclusion, one of the subversive things the film does is encourage us, against all expectation, to see things from the point of view of its often irritating protagonist.</p>, <p>Maybe, just maybe, Norman's ability to create an intricate filigree of favors and obligation makes him not a man on the make but an unintentional saint, engaged in the sacred task of <em>tikkun olam</em>, the repair of a broken world. It's something you'll have to think about, and providing that kind of substance is what Joseph Cedar's films are always about.</p>, <p>------------</p>, <p><strong>‘Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer’</strong></p>, <p>Unrated </p>, <p><strong>Rating:</strong> R, for some language</p>, <p><strong>Running time:</strong> 1 hour, 58 minutes</p>, <p><strong>Playing:</strong> Arclight, Hollywood; Landmark, West Los Angeles</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:kenneth.turan@latimes.com" target="_blank">kenneth.turan@latimes.com</a></strong></p>, <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/KennethTuran" target="_blank">@KennethTuran</a></strong></p>][<p>Justin Chang reviews "Graduation," directed by Cristian Mungiu and starring Adrian Titieni, Maria-Victoria Dragus and Rares Andrici. Video by Jason H. Neubert.</p>, <p>Justin Chang reviews "Graduation," directed by Cristian Mungiu and starring Adrian Titieni, Maria-Victoria Dragus and Rares Andrici. Video by Jason H. Neubert.</p>, <p>“Graduation,” a film of gripping moral suspense from the Romanian writer-director Cristian Mungiu, opens with a rock being hurled through the window of a middle-aged doctor named Romeo (Adrian Titieni). It is the first of several attacks that take place over the course of the movie, including a second act of vandalism and an attempted sexual assault. Mungiu’s purpose here is not to identify the guilty (which would take a while), but rather to establish an atmosphere of ambiguous unease.</p>, <p>Bleak, naturalistic and flawlessly acted, “Graduation” distills the mood and moral decay of a place whose gray skies and nondescript housing blocks feel like permanent reminders of its dark history. Unlike Mungiu’s 2007 masterpiece, “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,” which unfolded in the final days of Nicolae Ceausescu’s Communist dictatorship, the new film is set in the present, but the past continues to cast a long shadow. A sense of desperation, mostly venal but sometimes violent, seems to hover in the very air these men and women breathe.</p>, <p>And while Romeo is a mild-mannered, outwardly respectable contributor to society, his own sins — far more than those committed against him and his family — are what seem to interest the movie most. “I have this feeling someone’s following me,” he says, and that someone might as well be the filmmaker himself, whose hyper-alert camera stays fixed on the good (and sometimes not-so-good) doctor as he navigates a labyrinth of personal and professional corruption.</p>, <p>The drama is set in motion when his teenage daughter, Eliza (Maria Dragus), fends off a would-be rapist on her way to school one morning — a senseless attack that disturbs Romeo for reasons beyond the initial shock and lingering trauma. Eliza is about to take the final exams that could secure her a scholarship to Cambridge, and the attack comes as an ill-timed blow to her academic future, rattling her nerves, shattering her wrist and forcing her to wear a heavy cast that, the exam proctors worry, might be concealing a cheat sheet.</p>, <p>Their suspicions turn out to be thoroughly justified, not because Eliza is a cheater but because just about everyone else is. Over the course of two sharply plotted, grimly absorbing hours, “Graduation” becomes a steady accrual of petty vices, under-the-table exchanges and quiet betrayals. Some of these have been happening for a while, like Romeo’s affair with a single mother, Sandra (Malina Manovici) — a detail foreshadowed here by his chilly estrangement from his long-suffering wife, Magda (Lia Bugnar).</p>, <p>The love that Romeo and Magda might have once felt for one another — perhaps before they returned to Romania from exile in 1991, hoping for a better life post-Communism — has long since been displaced entirely onto their daughter, along with what remains of their hopes and dreams. That Eliza might escape this dreadful place is all that matters to Romeo, even if it means calling in favors with an old friend at the police station (Vlad Ivanov), a tight-lipped exam board official (Gelu Colceag) and an ailing politician (Petre Ciubotaru) who might benefit from his professional attention.</p>, <p>Romeo, like some of his conspirators, tries to reassure himself that these machinations are necessary, a last-minute deviation from an otherwise strict ethical code that he prides himself on upholding. But “Graduation” gives the lie to such self-serving reassurances. No less than “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,” which similarly used a compressed time frame to shed light on a condition of long-term malaise, this is a movie about the moral cost of survival — the negotiations and compromises that each character must continually make with others, and with his or her own conscience.</p>, <p>Mungiu, who shared the directing prize at last year’s Cannes Film Festival (with Olivier Assayas for “Personal Shopper”), is a master of concentration. Working for the first time with the cinematographer Tudor Vladimir Panduru, the director invests his characters’ mundane conversations with a hushed, almost conspiratorial intensity. At its best, Mungiu’s style achieves the clarity of the confessional: His characters may deflect and dissemble, but the camera, with its restless following movements and unblinking long takes, gives them no room to hide.</p>, <p>At times Titieni, with his fine-grained Everyman schlumpiness, brings to mind Olivier Gourmet, the great Belgian actor often cast in the restless, relentlessly compassionate films of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (who happen to be credited among “Graduation’s” co-producers). But Romeo’s failings are held in check, and to some extent corrected, by Eliza, a sensitive child who finds herself caught between obedience, disillusionment and her own desire for freedom — including the freedom to continue seeing her boyfriend, Marius (Rares Andrici), whom Romeo can’t abide.</p>, <p>Art-house audiences may recall the gifted Dragus as one of the young children in “The White Ribbon,” Michael Haneke’s 2009 portrait of a pre-World War I town in the grip of an eerily pervasive evil. There is something of Haneke’s steely observation in “Graduation,” but there is also a warmer, more hopeful vision of humanity — a grace born of the film’s toughness and clarity of vision.</p>, <p>------------</p>, <p><strong>‘Graduation’</strong></p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating:</strong> R, for some language</p>, <p><strong>Running time:</strong> 2 hours, 8 minutes</p>, <p><strong>Playing:</strong> Laemmle’s Royal Theatre, Los Angeles</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:justin.chang@latimes.com" target="_blank">justin.chang@latimes.com</a></strong></p>, <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/JustinCChang">@JustinCChang</a></strong></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>][<p>It sounds paradoxical but, if done right, films about a life ending can be the most life-affirming films you'll see. “Truman,” a great success in its native Spain, is definitely done right.</p>, <p>Essentially a two-hander about a terminally ill man and his lifelong best friend, "Truman" swept the 2016 Goyas, Spain's equivalent to the Academy Awards, winning best film, screenplay and director as well as actor and supporting actor for its pair of veteran stars.</p>, <p>That would be Ricardo Darin, Argentina’s biggest attraction, best known in this country for “The Secret in Their Eyes,” and Javier Cámara, who has appeared in several <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/pedro-almodovar-PECLB000101-topic.html" id="PECLB000101" title="Pedro Almodovar">Pedro Almodovar</a> films, including “Talk to Her” and “Bad Education.”</p>, <p>Darin and Camára, who also shared the best actor prize at Spain’s prestigious San Sebastian festival, were director Cesc Gay's first choices, and it’s not hard to see why.</p>, <p>Both accomplished performers for whom not pushing too hard is second nature, they are ideal for this feelingly done, honest and very human story about what is wanted from life as death approaches, a satisfying film that is moving in both expected and unexpected ways.</p>, <p>Though it’s set in Madrid, “Truman” begins not there but on an early morning in Canada, where Tomas (Cámara) is saying goodbye to his wife and young children before taking off for Spain, where he is paying a visit to best friend Julian (Darin).</p>, <p>The visit is a surprise, but the underlying reason for it is not. Julian has found out that the <a href="/topic/health/diseases-illnesses/lung-cancer-HEDAI0000027-topic.html" id="HEDAI0000027" title="Lung Cancer">lung cancer</a> he thought had been contained has in fact dangerously metastasized.</p>, <p>More than that, tipped off by Julian’s attractive cousin Paula (Dolores Fonzi), Tomas knows that Julian, sick of hospitals and medical regimens, has decided not to have the cancer treated anymore. “I’m done,” he tells his friend, and it’s clear he means it.</p>, <p>In a lesser scenario, “Truman” would be taken up by Tomas trying to change Julian’s mind, but here Tomas quickly realizes that his friend cannot be dissuaded by him or anyone else.</p>, <p>Instead, Tomas spends the four days he has left of his trip in Madrid accompanying Julian as his friend tries to tie up the loose ends in his life and arrange things ahead of time so that his death is not a burden to the survivors.</p>, <p>Though the two men could not be closer, they are far from identical, which leads to considerable amount of amusing bickering between the two.</p>, <p>Tomas, a scientist back home in Canada, is a planner and worrier, while Julian, an actor who is still working on stage, is dramatic and emotional, someone who enjoys nothing better than making a scene — like the one he creates when he berates colleagues who are avoiding him because of his illness.</p>, <p>The darkly amusing situations the men navigate together include shopping for a casket and dealing with the producer of the play Julian is in. But much of their time is taken up with the character that gives the film its name.</p>, <p>Truman, however, is not a person but a dog, a large and elderly bullmastiff with a mind of its own that Julian, with his son at university in Amsterdam, considers to be his second child.</p>, <p>Completely consumed with Truman's well-being, Julian has a comical conversation with a vet about how the dog will react to his death and even takes meetings with a series of potential adoptive families who would inherit the dog when he dies.</p>, <p>Julian believes that “the only thing that matters in life is relationships,” but because this bromide is  harder to put into practice than he anticipates, it’s a pleasure to watch these believable individuals as they try. “Each person dies as best they can,” the actor says, and those indeed prove to be words to live by.</p>, <p>------------------</p>, <p>Not rated.</p>, <p><strong>Running time:</strong> 1 hour, 48 minutes.</p>, <p><strong>Playing:</strong> Laemmle's Royal, West Los Angeles, Playhouse 7, Pasadena.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:kenneth.turan@latimes.com" target="_blank">kenneth.turan@latimes.com</a></strong></p>, <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/KennethTuran" target="_blank">@KennethTuran</a></strong></p>, <p><strong><strong>ALSO</strong></strong></p>, <p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-norman-rise-fall-review-20170413-story.html" target="_blank">Review: An exceptional Richard Gere powers ‘Norman’ through highs and lows in New York</a></strong></strong></p>, <p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-heal-the-living-review-20170413-story.html" target="_blank">Review: 'Heal the Living' is a heartfelt, surprising story that resonates with life</a></strong></strong></p>, <p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-critics-choice-20170413-story.html" target="_blank">Critic's Choice: Marcel Ophüls' war crimes doc 'The Memory of Justice' gets new life</a></strong></strong></p>][<p>Unusual in its story, unexpected in its structure, made with an unerring instinct for emotional connection, "Heal the Living" wallops us without ever overplaying its hand.</p>, <p>Co-written and directed by France's Katell Quillevere, "Heal the Living" reveals a gift for joining skillful visual filmmaking with moving, affecting storytelling, all in the service of a story that unfolds in surprising ways.</p>, <p>"Heal the Living" is an ensemble film, despite having Tahar Rahim and Emmanuelle Seigner, two of France’s top actors in key roles, as it follows not an individual but an actual human heart. Involved in this story, adapted by the director and Gilles Taurand from a successful novel, is the teenage boy the heart came from, the mature woman it might be going to, and the two teams of doctors trying to make  that  transition work.</p>, <p>Though there are some heartbreaking flashbacks, these people are introduced sequentially, as their time in the narrative arrives, which adds an energy to the proceedings. The one thing that unites the boy and the woman, the film's heartening through line, are those doctors, brought to vivid life not as saints  but  like everyone else in "Heal the Living," people striving to be at their best for the challenges life inevitably throws at them.</p>, <p>Seen first is 17-year-old Simon (Gabin Verdet), introduced in the port city of Le Havre taking a clandestine early morning departure from the room of his high school sweetheart Juliette (Galatea Bellugi). Devoted to cycling and in general yearning for activity, Simon is not so much a daredevil as an exulter in physicality, in the joy of being alive.</p>, <p>Meeting up with two friends, he hops into a van for a ride to some early morning surfing. Beautifully shot (as the whole film is) by Tom Harari, the surfing has the potential for danger inherent in the sport, but the problem for Simon comes not in the water but on the drive back.</p>, <p>Presented to us in a unusual visual way, Simon's accident puts him in a local hospital, unconscious with severe brain damage and no chance of recovery.</p>, <p>Enter now the hospital's staff, primarily senior surgeon Pierre (Boult Lanners), rumpled, all business yet caring, and, later, medical specialist Thomas, the physician who deals with potential organ donations, played with a convincing sensitivity by Rahim, who shot to French stardom with Jacques Audiard's very different "Un Prophete."</p>, <p>Added at this point are Simon's estranged and distraught parents, first his mother, Marianne (an impressive Seigner), and then father Vincent (French rapper Kool Shen), who holds himself responsible because he introduced his son to surfing.</p>, <p>Unwilling to believe that their son, hooked up to machines and looking still alive, is in fact brain dead, the parents are confronted by Pierre, who says simply, "it's the truth and you have to hear it." Unwilling to even consider organ donation at first, they go home to think about it, understanding that the clock is ticking on how long their son's body will remain viable for saving other lives.</p>, <p>Brought into the mix next is Claire (French Canadian actress Anne Dorval), a difficult Parisian whose weak heart is getting weaker. We meet the people important to her, including her two sons, a concert pianist (Alice Taglioni) she has been close to, and the medical team she will work with if the transplant is to happen.</p>, <p>Laying out "Heal the Living's" plot this way makes its filmmaking style feel more straight ahead than it is. In reality,  Quillevere is guided by the logic of emotion as much as any narrative thread, giving this, her third feature, a remarkable sense of immediacy, always alive to the expressive potential of each scene.</p>, <p>The best illustration of this is the exquisitely crafted flashback scene of the moments when Simon and Juliette became a couple. It's appearance in the film feels random but it is not, it is perfectly placed to create maximum expressive resonance.

The collage at work in Shaw’s debut feature is both figurative and, considering the layering of drawing, painting and photographic image, literal.</p>, <p>The same goes for the fault lines that run through cliff-side Tides High School: They define the students’ group-segregated lives yet also exist as a reality underneath the building. Shaw’s self-named anti-hero Dash (the voice of <a href="/topic/entertainment/jason-schwartzman-PECLB0000006665-topic.html" id="PECLB0000006665" title="Jason Schwartzman">Jason Schwartzman</a>) and bespectacled Assaf (Reggie Watts) are outcast best buds who fancy themselves muckrakers for their school paper, which is edited by the third member of their misfit trio, bookish Verti (<a href="/topic/entertainment/maya-rudolph-PECLB0000008054-topic.html" id="PECLB0000008054" title="Maya Rudolph">Maya Rudolph</a>). When Dash’s over-sensitivity threatens to break up the gang, he turns on his friends, but in bitter exile also discovers the scoop of his sophomore life: a top-down scandal exposing the building as not being up to the earthquake safety code.</p>, <p>Nobody believes Dash, because he’s a serial exaggerator. But he’s proved right the hard way when the mildest of subterranean shocks sends the school sliding into the Pacific. The only true escape — from sharks, drowning or students still harboring lingering school resentments — means finding one’s way to the roof, and making unlikely friends, including the aforementioned Lunch Lady Lorraine (Susan Sarandon) and a snobby joiner named Mary (<a href="/topic/entertainment/lena-dunham-PECLB00013059-topic.html" id="PECLB00013059" title="Lena Dunham">Lena Dunham</a> in the Molly Ringwald role).</p>, <p>As externalized visions of high school hellishness go, Shaw’s doesn’t always translate into the most cohesively entertaining of mash-ups, but his techniques are attention-grabbers. Sometimes, it’s as if Lynda Barry were a cutout-mad Fauvist. Sometimes, it’s the trippiest “Scooby-Doo” episode you’ve ever seen. The strangely mixed sound design for the deadpan dialogue simultaneously recalls Robert Altman and <a href="/topic/entertainment/judd-apatow-PECLB005346-topic.html" id="PECLB005346" title="Judd Apatow">Judd Apatow</a>. Most of the time, characters are crudely rendered in simple lines, but one wistful recollection of a camp summer features detailed illustrations that feel like something out of Highlights magazine (until the jokey closeup of urine-stained underwear breaks that spell).</p>, <p>But even at its most art-installation-like — when your attention might be tempted to wander as Shaw wrestles with focusing on story or visuals — it percolates with the imagination of a passionate few artists, rather than narcotizes in the manner of industrialized animation, and that’s a beautiful thing. Sleeping sharks get ZZZs above their heads. A character’s color — it often changes — usually feels connected to the intensity of what he or she is feeling. And sometimes there’s a photograph of a  cotton swab.</p>, <p>Better still, Shaw’s adventure story, with its shades of “The Poseidon Adventure,” allows for pockets of feeling that, though conceived as semi-winking homages to those “Breakfast Club”-like moments of class-divide understanding, still carry a measure of sincerity. For a movie that impishly likes cutting to animated lungs during its crisis-of-breath moments and gets edgy kicks out of depicting its high body count, it’s the film’s secretly beating heart — the awareness that surviving high school brings — that underlies its creativity. It makes Shaw’s frequent flights of head-scratching comic fancy even feel emotionally appropriate. Because, at a certain point, in the words of that other comic book movie, you’ll believe a poetically waxing lunch lady can fly.</p>, <p>-------------</p>, <p><strong>‘My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea’</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rating: </strong>PG-13 for some images of peril, sexual references and drug material</p>, <p><strong>Running Time:</strong> 1 hour, 17 minutes</p>, <p><strong>Playing: </strong>the NuArt</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:calendar@latimes.com" target="_blank">calendar@latimes.com</a></strong></p>][<p>Anyone who watched Sergio García’s thrilling sudden death victory in last weekend’s Masters knows that golf can be dramatic. That tradition goes back 150 years to the time of Old Tom Morris, who won the <a href="/topic/sports/golf/british-open-EVSPR000117-topic.html" id="EVSPR000117" title="British Open">Open Championship</a> (what Americans call the British Open) in 1861, 1862, 1864 and 1867, before passing the mantle to his son, Young Tom or Tommy Morris, also a four-time winner.</p>, <p>The Morrises and their flinty, but ultimately tender relationship are the subject of the handsomely produced drama “Tommy’s Honour,” directed by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-sunday-conversation-jason-connery-20170408-story.html">Jason Connery</a> and based on a book by Kevin Cook, who also wrote the screenplay with his wife, Pamela Marin.</p>, <p>Though ostensibly set on various links throughout Britain, this faithful and often moving film addresses much more than golf heroics, commenting on issues of tradition, class and family, especially the bonds between father and son.</p>, <p>Golf has changed a lot since the Morrises first teed their shots from small, handcrafted hills of dirt, and they contributed mightily to that modernization. Old Tom, the longtime greenskeeper at Scotland’s Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, helped organize the first Open, hand-crafted balls and clubs in his shop and designed dozens of courses, rapidly evolving a sport that had already been played for four centuries. Young Tommy was a true innovator on the links, creating shots and strategies that would affect the game for decades. </p>, <p>In the film, Tommy is played with antsy rebellion by Jack Lowden, who bears a strong resemblance to Dennis Christopher, star of the 1979 cycling film “Breaking Away,” another sports drama rooted in class with a strong father-son dynamic. Learning the game from Old Tom, played by Peter Mullan, Tommy surpasses his father by the time he is a teen.</p>, <p>Nothing but pride, and perhaps a lament of aging, passes over Old Tom’s face as he watches his son’s progress. The conflict between the two men largely emerges from Tommy’s rejection of his father’s working-class model of maintaining the course and attending to the club members’ needs with lessons and equipment. In other words, knowing his place.</p>, <p>In the 19th century, amateurism was idealized, with professional athletes viewed as something like prized thoroughbreds, though with less social standing. Club members, real “gentlemen,” staked professional golfers’ matches, gambling large sums of money and then paying the golfers a small cut of the winnings. Tommy Morris challenged the status quo, successfully demanding a larger share.</p>, <p>Tommy chafes at the idea of the already rich men profiting from his talent. A bit of a dandy, he sees how the upper class lives and wants a piece of the action, standing up to the club’s pompous chief, Alexander Boothby (cheekily played by Sam Neill), while earning the disapproval of Old Tom.</p>, <p>The elder Morris initially sees little need for change in a society that allows him to provide for his family, yet remain in debt. But through his love for Tommy, he bestows a begrudging acceptance. The veteran Mullan, best known for his work with Ken Loach and <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/danny-boyle-PECLB000624-topic.html" id="PECLB000624" title="Danny Boyle">Danny Boyle</a>, can do more with a narrowing of the eyes than most actors can with a soliloquy, and his ruddy features and stoic demeanor anchor the film, grounding it in social realism whenever it tends toward romanticism and sentimentality.</p>, <p>The younger Morris also bucks convention when he falls for Meg Drinnen (“Guardians of the Galaxy’s” Ophelia Lovibond), a maid  10 years his senior. The film pins much of its story on their romance, a match met with judgment from the community and strong displeasure from Tommy’s mother, Nancy (Therese Bradley). Fortunately, there is plenty of chemistry between Lowden and the winsome Lovibond, and their scenes of courtship both lighten the tone and earn our emotional investment.</p>, <p>Connery and his crew, including director of photography Gary Shaw, production designer James Lapsley and costume designer Rhonda Russell, richly evoke the harsh beauty of Scotland, while warmly re-creating the style and manners of the period. There’s a certain “Chariots of Fire”-like reverence for all things golf and Scottish, but the woolly courses, a far cry from the manicured fairways of today, and comparatively crude implements used by the players, provide an earthy balance.</p>, <p>However, “Tommy’s Honour’s” greatest strength turns out to be its primary weakness, as well. It’s surprisingly affecting, but there’s a tendency to telegraph these pivotal emotional moments that in a way lessens their effect.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong>It’s a tribute to the film’s overall craft,  and especially its cast, that <strong> </strong>it’s<strong> </strong>as much a winner as it is.</p>, <p>------------</p>, <p><strong>‘Tommy’s Honour’</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rating:</strong> PG, for thematic elements, some suggestive material, language and smoking</p>, <p><strong>Running time:</strong> 1 hour, 52 minutes</p>, <p><strong>Playing:</strong> In limited release</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:calendar@latimes.com" target="_blank">calendar@latimes.com</a></strong></p>][<p>Justin Chang reviews "The Fate of the Furious," directed by F.

You’ve got to admire that last part: It’s a plot point, a product placement <em>and</em> a well-timed Pepsi dig rolled into one.</p>, <p>It’s no spoiler to report that the Fleetline goes up in flames up after a hilariously overblown street race (it would be a spoiler to report that it doesn’t), shortly before flying through the air and crashing into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Havana. “The Fate of the Furious” is one of the first Hollywood productions to shoot in Cuba since the easing of diplomatic relations with the U.S. in 2014, which means that, for all its fun-in-the-sun frivolity, the movie inevitably reflects something about the political and economic moment that produced it.</p>, <p>It is many other things too: the eighth chapter in an improbably successful 16-year-old blockbuster franchise, a 2-hour, 15-minute  earplug commercial, an argument for the law of diminishing returns and the latest proof, as if proof were needed, that diversity sells. Years before #OscarsSoWhite became the depressing industry catchphrase, the “Fast &amp; Furious” movies were the glorious standard-bearer for multiplex multiculturalism, distinguished by an ever-shifting but fully integrated ensemble and a willingness to tap directors of color like John Singleton, Justin Lin and <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/james-wan-PECLB0015359-topic.html" id="PECLB0015359" title="James Wan">James Wan</a>.</p>, <p><a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/vin-diesel-PECLB001407-topic.html">Vin Diesel</a> is a tough guy tender enough to remember the last time he cried.

Sitting in an exquisitely upholstered chair of a Beverly Hills hotel suite discussing his “dark” turn in the latest “Fast &amp; Furious” film, he describes an emotional episode that transpired two days before, a familiar glint...</p>, <p>The latest filmmaker to join their ranks is F. Gary Gray, who recently directed “Straight Outta Compton” but whose most salient credit is his terrifically entertaining 2003 remake of “The Italian Job.” He has imported a few key elements from that automotive heist caper, though arguably too little of its sleek, snazzy elegance and too much <a href="/topic/entertainment/charlize-theron-PECLB003831-topic.html" id="PECLB003831" title="Charlize Theron">Charlize Theron</a> (four words I never thought I’d write).</p>, <p>With some clever cross-branding and better writing, we could have ended up with “The Fast and the Furiosa.” Instead we have Cipher (Theron), a seductive cyber-terrorist with blond dreadlocks, a red-bearded henchman (“Game of Thrones” actor Kristofer Hivju), and a drearily familiar code of winner-takes-all nihilism.</p>, <p>Cipher must have some mighty powerful leverage over Diesel’s Dom Toretto, who suddenly decides to help her procure a stash of nuclear weapons that could  trigger World War III, abandoning his new bride, Letty (Rodriguez), and their affectionate gang of globe-trotting gearheads in the process. That isn’t at all like Dom, who has made it clear that his favorite “F” word isn’t “fast” or “furious” but “family.” Nor, come to think of it, is it much like Diesel, who has seldom shown the inclination — or, frankly, the talent — to cloak his character’s motives in mystery.</p>, <p>His costars, for their part, are largely content to stay in the safe and familiar lanes plotted out for them in Chris Morgan’s script. Those bickering sidemen Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges) spend most of their time competing for the affections of ace hacker Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel, another “Game of Thrones” regular). Kurt Russell returns as a covert government operative, this time with Scott Eastwood in tow as his annoying protégé. And hey look, there’s Helen Mirren in a few “hey look, there’s Helen Mirren” scenes.</p>, <p>Naturally, Dwayne Johnson is back as Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs, who reluctantly pulls himself away from coaching his daughter’s soccer team to resume the thrill of the chase. But not even a gratuitously bone-crunching prison-break sequence — pitting him against his old nemesis Deckard Shaw (<a href="/topic/entertainment/jason-statham-PECLB0000006668-topic.html" id="PECLB0000006668" title="Jason Statham">Jason Statham</a>) and allowing for some choice one-liners of the “I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum” variety — can quite offset the feeling that the thrill is gone.</p>, <p>Ever since Dom and Hobbs went <em>mano a mano</em> in “Fast Five,” Diesel and Johnson have often seemed locked in a private competition of their own, as if to see who can imitate the world’s most expressive tree trunk. The two stars share precious little screen time here, and whether there’s any truth to the rumors of a behind-the-scenes “Furious” feud, that disconnect — the sense that the actors might as well have been digitally inserted alongside each other, for all the chemistry they achieve — spreads through the ensemble like a bad case of rust.</p>, <p>You may well argue that chemistry — and, for that matter, acting — is beside the point when it comes to some of the more outlandishly incoherent set pieces in “The Fate of the Furious,” and you wouldn’t be entirely wrong. At one point Cipher turns virtually every car in Manhattan into a self-driving weapon, and then, just for kicks, sends about 50 of them careening out of an upper-story parking structure, in what may be the cinema’s first scene of vehicular mass suicide.</p>, <p>And even that feels like a warm-up act — or perhaps a cool-down act — for the climactic showdown in freezing-cold Russia (actually played by Iceland), where a parade of speeding cars and exploding trucks are upstaged by a wayward submarine. No spluttering Vladimir Putin reaction shots are in store, alas, though given the movie’s level of anything-goes insanity (or is it indifference?), they would hardly have felt out of place.</p>, <p>All this testifies, I suppose, to the ongoing durability of a franchise that started out in 2001 as little more than hot rods and cheap thrills, before unexpectedly hitting its creative and commercial stride a few movies later. But after the ultra-stylish detour of “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,” the unfiltered action-movie exhilaration of “Fast Five” and the emotional high of “Furious 7,” with its moving elegy for the late <a href="/topic/entertainment/paul-walker-PECLB0000007766-topic.html" id="PECLB0000007766" title="Paul Walker">Paul Walker</a>, the series seems to have at last entered its frustrating, decadent, spinning-its-wheels phase.</p>, <p>The theme of “The Fate of the Furious” — not to be missed among all the hot babes, fast cars, private planes and big bangs — is betrayal, and not just because Dom suddenly goes rogue. The sudden recasting of murderous bad guy Deckard as a good guy may be a necessary expedient from a narrative point of view, and it does yield a pretty amusing homage to John Woo’s classic “Hard Boiled.”</p>, <p>But it is also likely to induce whiplash, and not the good kind, for those fans who have invested something of themselves in this series, enjoying its utter lack of pretension while taking its emotional core  seriously. “The Fate of the Furious” isn’t going to bomb, to be sure.

Curated by the L.A.-based critics Jordan Cronk and Robert Koehler, and presented at the Downtown Independent, this weekend-long program of 10 features and five shorts offers a jolting antidote to the mid-spring blockbuster blues, as well as a welcome reminder that cinema isn’t just a global medium; at times, it can be downright otherworldly.</p>, <p>The program gets off to a pleasing start on Friday night with “Hermia &amp; Helena,” the latest Shakespearean riff from the New York-based Argentine director Matías Piñeiro. Just as his earlier works “The Princess of France” and “Viola” respectively riffed on “Love’s Labour’s Lost” and “Twelfth Night,” the new movie hinges loosely on “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” which Camila (Agustina Muñoz), a Buenos Aires theater director who has recently relocated to the Big Apple, is attempting to translate into Spanish.</p>, <p>The play’s intricate roundelay of romantic complications and mistaken identities is  loosely reproduced in Piñeiro’s clever shuffling of characters, time frames and locations. “Hermia &amp; Helena” toggles restlessly between New York and Buenos Aires, gives Camila an alter ego in the form of another young woman, Carmen (María Villar), and at times even superimposes two establishing shots in the same frame — a ghostly, dissolve-like effect that underscores the poignant sense of homesickness at the heart of the story.</p>, <p>One of the program’s most accessible titles is the centerpiece selection, “Rat Film,” Theo Anthony’s brilliant, uncategorizable documentary on the notoriously large rodent population in his native Baltimore. The human implications of this phenomenon, especially as regards the city’s long history of racial segregation and substandard living conditions for African Americans, are among the many threads freely at play in this mind-expanding experiment, which leaves you regarding both species in a slightly different light.</p>, <p>Not quite as brisk or playful is the festival’s Sunday closing-night selection, “Scarred Hearts,” a slow-burning 1930s-set hospital drama that finds the Romanian writer-director Radu Jude veering away from the epic Western thrills of his 2016 feature, “Aferim!” If relentless action is more your speed, you might consider subjecting yourself to Tetsuya Mariko’s brutal, unsparing anti-thriller “Distraction Babies,” about a young Japanese sociopath (Yuya Yagira) who likes nothing more than pummeling random strangers and getting pummeled himself in return.</p>, <p>Eduardo Williams’ “The Human Surge” is a mysterious and poetic triptych that wanders from Argentina to Mozambique to the Philippines, finding a wondrously imaginative transition each time. In each new environment the film alights on a different group of young people, observing their comings, goings and random hangouts with an eye that feels at once alert and oddly dispassionate. Your attention may flag at times — even the movie’s seems to — but the roving, unimpeded movement of the camera keeps you watching.</p>, <p>By contrast, the camera stays mostly still in “All the Cities of the North,” a quietly immersive debut feature from  Yugoslavian director Dane Komljen, which follows two men who have set up camp in an abandoned, dilapidated hotel complex somewhere in southern Montenegro. With its expressive use of landscapes (both natural and man-made) and its relaxed, middle-of-nowhere intimacy, this is a beautifully unhurried picture that, like many of the best offerings at Locarno in Los Angeles, seems less interested in telling you a simple story than in recalibrating your internal rhythms.

The girls seem impossibly young, and at times, impossibly wise beyond their years, wrestling with family issues, mental health, money, sexuality, death and hardest of all, life itself.</p>, <p>Gage and cinematographer Tom Betterton were granted incredible access to the lives of these girls and respect that trust. They never shy away from the tough or unflattering moments, and capture many vulnerable and soul-bearing moments. The dreams and insecurities and struggles of these girls are specific, and so universal. “All This Panic” is a deeply felt tribute to youth but also to growing up; it’s a time capsule of a fleeting, fragile moment when angst is mixed with beauty and everything seems ripe with potential.</p>, <p>-------------</p>, <p><strong>‘All This Panic’</strong></p>, <p>Not rated</p>, <p><strong>Running time:</strong> 1 hour, 19 minutes</p>, <p><strong>Playing:</strong> Arena Cinelounge Las Palmas, Hollywood;  Arena Cinelounge, Santa Monica</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/popular/">See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>"The Last Jedi" continues the episodic story of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a few original characters, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>Inspired by true events, "The Promise" stars Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>"Step" is a documentary about a girls' high school step dance team in Baltimore. </p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller star in "The Lost City of Z."</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p>"Detroit," from the director of "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty," stars John Boyega and is based on the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of 1967.</p>, <p><strong><a href="mailto:calendar@latimes.com" target="_blank">calendar@latimes.com</a></strong></p>][<p>Unless you’re a jazz aficionado or a denizen of New York’s classier nightclubs and society functions, you may not be familiar with the work of Vince Giordano — even though the bandleader and music archivist has been one of the most in-demand early 20th century Americana revivalists for decades.</p>, <p>Dave Davidson and Amber Edwards’ documentary “Vince Giordano: There’s a Future in the Past” is a fine introduction to a musician so respected that filmmakers like Woody Allen and <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/martin-scorsese-PECLB004197-topic.html" id="PECLB004197" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> have called on him to help re-create the sounds of the ’20s and ’30s in their period pictures.

Soon the family members find themselves in their huge new house, waiting on their moving truck, getting to know their new neighbors and colleagues.</p>, <p>Written by Annie J. Howell and directed by Rob Meyer, “Little Boxes” is almost anthropological in its dissection of the cultural quirks of suburban life. There is an unsettling fixation on race that pervades every new interaction with the interracial family. While Mack is profiled by his new neighbors, Clark’s new classmates are fascinated by the diversity he brings to their lily-white burg.

China" was released in theaters on April 21, 2017.</p>, <p>"Born in China" is the latest installment in the "Disneynature" documentary series. It's "Planet Earth" aimed at younger audiences, but any nature lovers can find enjoyment here, especially in the stunning cinematography. While other installments have focused on specific species and eco-systems, "Born in China," directed by Lu Chuan, gets up close and personal with some of the unique species found in China — pandas, snow leopards, cranes, Chiru antelope and golden monkeys. Chuan's team follows these incredible animals through the seasons and throughout the circle of life while incorporating Chinese spiritual beliefs about life and death.</p>, <p>John Krasinski does his best Sir David Attenborough as the narrator of "Born in China," though he doesn't achieve that singular mix of gravitas and cheeky wit that the "Life" and "Planet Earth" legend brings to those classic nature documentaries. Krasinski's vocal stylings are perfectly homey and serviceable for the task of guiding us through the lives of these special animals.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>The footage captured is breathtaking for its access and intimacy to these incredible creatures. A few outtakes during the credits offer a look inside the production process, which involves both stationary secret cameras attached to rocks and the like, as well as production crews trekking out into the wilderness to capture images. The small taste of behind-the-scenes information is so fascinating that you'd almost want to watch an entire documentary just about this process.</p>, <p>The drama captured is remarkable, from a territorial snow leopard standoff to the first steps of a baby panda and the antics of a group of young golden monkeys — though it's clear that some of these interactions have been coaxed together by creative editors for maximum narrative enjoyment. The editors weave stories worthy of any Disney classic — Tao Tao the golden monkey is shunned by his family after the arrival of his baby sister, but his peers, the Lost Boys, don't offer much solace either. Dawa the snow leopard hunts ferociously to provide for her cubs, but is it enough? Ya Ya the panda carefully guides her baby, Mei Mei, through the process of growing up.</p>, <p>The panda cub Mei Mei in "Born in China." </p>, <p>The panda cub Mei Mei in "Born in China." </p>, <p>As deliciously cute and cuddly as Mei Mei and Ya Ya are, the breakout stars are definitely the golden monkeys. These curious creatures sport bright marigold fur and bluish-gray faces with huge expressive eyes. Their expressions and gestures are startlingly human, and there's plenty of interpersonal and group drama to sustain their storyline, as Tao Tao leaves the family fold and returns after saving his baby sister from a hawk.</p>, <p>The Disneynature films are always released close to Earth Day and strive to educate audiences about the importance of preserving nature. A message before the screening announced that seeing the film opening weekend would help raise funds for saving these animals. But as a nature film, "Born in China" stays resolutely within the confines of its region and topic. From watching the film, one wouldn't know if these animals were endangered or threatened by manmade development, predators or climate change. The message stays firmly on spiritual questions about the circle of life, but doesn't educate or leave the audience with a call to action about how to personally act to protect these animals, and that feels like a missed opportunity.</p>, <p><strong>"Born in China"</strong> — 2.5 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating</strong>: G</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 1:16</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday</p>, <p><strong>RELATED STORIES:</strong></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-lost-city-z-mov-rev-0418-20170418-column.html">'The Lost City of Z': Charlie Hunnam leads Amazon expedition in spellbinding drama </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-norman-mov-rev-0417-20170417-column.html">'Norman' review: Richard Gere persuasive as a desperate New York 'consultant' </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-promise-review-20170420-story.html">'The Promise' review: Armenian genocide takes back seat to love triangle  </a></p>, <p>

Check out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.</p>][<p>The child is very much father to the man in "Staying Vertical," a serenely nutty cinematic pastoral that unfolds at the crossroads of life and death, freedom and responsibility, this world and the next. The film follows a screenwriter in his 30s named Leo (Damien Bonnard) into the open countryside, where he shacks up with a shepherdess, has a baby boy and soon finds himself dealing with much more than just a crippling case of writer's block.</p>, <p>The movie, for its part, hardly wants for creative inspiration. You could probably imagine a much straighter (in every sense) version of this story — one that doesn't feature quite as many growling wolves, eccentric sexual configurations and scenes of botanical electrode therapy.</p>, <p>But really, where would be the fun in that? Writer-director Alain Guiraudie has a gift for burrowing his way into the human soul by way of the libido, and he works in a searching, serio-comic style that refuses to separate life's wildest extremes into neat, narratively expedient compartments. With "Staying Vertical," he has made the sort of movie that is often described as "not knowing what kind of film it wants to be" — a dismissal that, in this case, should instead be considered high praise.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>Guiraudie came to international prominence with his 2013 Cannes Film Festival sensation "Stranger by the Lake," a wickedly seductive thriller that observed the comings and goings at a secluded gay cruising spot with both erotic heat and chilly analytical rigor. To say that "Staying Vertical" touches on some of the same preoccupations — the great outdoors, the dark side of desire, manhood and its discontents — is at once perfectly true and faintly misleading. What it lacks in its predecessor's exacting formal control, the new movie more than makes up for in its capacity to surprise. It could be titled "Stranger by the Minute."</p>, <p>It begins simply enough. Leo finds himself traveling among the windswept wilds of southwestern France (beautifully photographed by Claire Mathon), searching for writerly inspiration and fascinated by the wolves that inhabit the region. He falls into bed with a rural woman named Marie (India Hair), who oversees a flock of sheep with her gruff dad, Jean-Louis (Raphaël Thiéry), and her two young sons. She soon gives birth to a third, an event that Guiraudie observes in unsparingly gooey detail — one of several full-frontal close-ups that, under the camera's unflinching gaze, seem to evoke Gustave Courbet's famous nude, "The Origin of the World."</p>, <p>But Marie, the only female character of any stature, soon recedes from the picture, moving to the city with her two older sons and leaving Leo to care for their infant alone. Leo continues to drift, putting off the screenplay he's writing and dragging his son along from scene to scene with an odd mix of affection and carelessness.</p>, <p>He also pays regular visits to a nearby cottage where Marcel (Christian Bouillette), a grouchy old shut-in who likes to blast Pink Floyd and yell anti-gay slurs at his houseguest, a sullen young man named Yoan (Basile Meilleurat). Their love-hate codependency seems forever on the brink of shifting into outright homoerotic desire, and it finds a strange echo in Leo's own continually evolving relationship with Jean-Louis.</p>, <p>By the time Leo gets into a canoe and paddles his way downriver in search of a marsh-dwelling plant therapist (Laure Calamy), "Staying Vertical" has taken on the demented illogic and inexplicable clarity of a dream. Not the kind of dream that teems with bold, hallucinatory imagery, but rather the kind that thrives on steadily escalating degrees of narrative derangement, in which even the story's weirdest formulations seem rooted in the banality of the everyday.</p>, <p>Characters disappear at random only to reemerge in strange new configurations. Traditional roles are slyly recast; people you didn't think knew each other turn out to know each other. The movie's circular, repetitive structure increasingly seems to mirror the cyclical nature of all existence. Sex is linked as closely to death as it is to life, l'origin du monde and la petite mort rolled into one.</p>, <p>Its title a sly reference to what distinguishes men from beasts, "Staying Vertical" hinges on the tension between primal instincts and socially proscribed behavior. Guiraudie isn't just trying to decimate sexual taboos; he is also taking gently comic aim at the overly rigid roles into which people tend to lock themselves. And he has an ideal collaborator in Bonnard, the kind of actor who keeps you at a slight remove initially only to become an increasingly empathetic figure as the movie wends its way toward its strange, and strangely moving, destination.</p>, <p>Of all the roles a man might be called on to play in the world — father, lover, protector, provider — how does he reconcile any single one with all the others? Guiraudie's crazily compassionate filmmaking creates a space for all manner of male fantasies and anxieties, however dark, shameful or grotesque, to assert themselves. And he does this without losing sight of those wolves prowling at the edges of the story — a reminder of the very real predators lying out there in wait, to say nothing of those lurking within.</p>, <p><em><a href="mailto:justin.chang@latimes.com">justin.chang@latimes.com</a></em></p>, <p><strong>"Staying Vertical" </strong>— 3 stars</p>, <p><strong>No MPAA rating</strong></p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 1:40</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday at the Gene Siskel Film Center, 164 N.

While the incident is not medically serious, it troubles the man watching over the unhappy perpetrator. That's no way to behave, the man, a doctor, says. "So how should I behave?" the boy replies.</p>, <p>He doesn't get much of an answer, but it's the key question for every character in writer-director Cristian Mungiu's "Graduation," a beautifully spun and morally searching tale of interlocking compromises. Set in a post-communist Transylvanian mountain town, where corruption floats in the air like a permanent morning haze, Mungiu's film arrives in a limited commercial run at a time when a lot of very fine new films have come out to play. If not quite as sharp as Mungiu's "4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days" or "Beyond the Hills," "Graduation" nonetheless offers sharp, steady insights into precarious human conditions hardly limited to Romania after Ceausescu.</p>, <p>The doctor protagonist is Romeo (Adrian Titieni, perfectly modulating his degrees of frustration and anger and self-loathing). For a year or so he has been stepping out on his depressive wife (Lia Bugnar) with the mother (Malina Manovici) of the young boy. The doctor and his wife fled Romania years earlier but returned in 1991, we learn, with the hope of improving life in his homeland. Now all hopes are pinned on their bright, hardworking teenage daughter (Maria Dragus), who's on the verge of getting out herself, by way of a Cambridge University scholarship.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>She need only pass a final exam. Off-screen, in the first few minutes of "Graduation," the daughter is assaulted on the way to school. With her arm in a cast, and her nerves badly shaken, suddenly a routine final test becomes a monumental difficulty. Romeo takes action, right or wrong, in order to protect his daughter's future.</p>, <p>From there Mungiu illustrates the fine art of one hand washing another hand, and another, and another. Romeo's police chief friend (Vlad Ivanov, Romania's poster boy for vaguely menacing figures of authority) suggests that Romeo move the city's vice mayor (Petre Ciubotaru) up a few notches on a live transplant waiting list. In exchange, the politician can pull a few strings regarding the final exam. Meantime Romeo's mistress wants her young son placed in a certain public school, one that is technically already at capacity. (Chicago Public Schools parents will find much sweat-inducing detail to relate to here.)</p>, <p>Everybody cheats, a little or a lot. At one point, Romeo is interrogated at work by a pair of deadpan public prosecutors, one of whom says: "He who persists in illegality will probably have to pay for it." The way the actor mutters the line, the word "probably" has never seemed less probable.</p>, <p>Like the work of Iranian writer-director Asghar Farhadi ("A Separation"), Mungiu's films are stern, carefully paced dramas of queasy compromise and evasion. Unsolved riddles persist, though here there's a touch of the schematic in their deployment. In the opening shot, a rock smashes an apartment building window. Is Romeo being stalked? Is someone on to his infidelity? The outlook here cannot escape the influence of a nation bear-trapped by its own recent history.

That fact alone makes director and co-writer Terry George's "The Promise" intriguing enough. Historical fiction generally has it over documentaries in inspiring mass interest, especially when actors as appealing as <a href="/topic/entertainment/oscar-isaac-PECLB0000008755-topic.html" id="PECLB0000008755" title="Oscar Isaac">Oscar Isaac</a>, <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/christian-bale-PECLB000324-topic.html" id="PECLB000324" title="Christian Bale">Christian Bale</a> and Charlotte Le Bon are involved.</p>, <p>And indeed, "The Promise" is a sprawling and handsome epic set around the extermination of 1.5 million Armenians in Ottoman Turkey. But despite the best of intentions, the film fails to properly explain and contextualize both what led to that disgraceful episode, which Turkey to this day denies, and why it escalated as it did. Instead, "The Promise" chooses to focus in on an unsympathetic love triangle that manages to trivialize the film overall.</p>, <p>The goal, as always, is to personalize the events that are too big and too devastating to look at as a whole — to make it about the lives interrupted, cut short and thrown into turmoil because of external forces. Thus we're given the character Michael Boghosian (Isaac), an Armenian medical student from a small village in Southern Turkey who uses his fiancée's dowry to study modern medicine in Constantinople. Michael isn't in love with his fiancée (Angela Sarafyan), but such is life in Siroun where marriages are arranged and he doesn't have any other choice. He kisses her goodbye and heads off to the big city, promising to return in just a few years.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>Constantinople is an oasis of temptation for Michael, who essentially falls for the first woman he sees. The beguiling Ana (Le Bon) is a cosmopolitan beauty and intellectual. She lived in Paris for years. She exudes ethereal confidence. And she's an Armenian from around his hometown. Ana also happens to be in a long-term relationship with Chris Myers (Bale), an Associated Press reporter who we're told drinks too much.</p>, <p>While Michael is enjoying the city life and lusting after Ana, though, things are devolving around him. It's 1914 and vague signs of war are emerging. Things go on as normal for a little while — there are German soldiers at the parties now and battleships in the harbor and a heightened sense that some Turks are anti-Armenian. And then Constantinople's Armenian intellectuals start getting arrested and taken away. To where is unclear. To fight? To prison camps? To be executed?</p>, <p>The intention, likely, is to put the viewer on the blurry ground level with Michael and Ana, who see their world turned upside down so suddenly that of course there would be confusion. Explanation and insight is hardly a priority when survival is the goal. But that's where Bale's Chris Myers should have been more useful.</p>, <p>This image released by Open Road Films shows Charlotte Le Bon, from left, Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale in a scene from "The Promise."</p>, <p>This image released by Open Road Films shows Charlotte Le Bon, from left, Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale in a scene from "The Promise."</p>, <p>To the film's credit, he does take us early on to distant villages to witness townspeople being rounded up and walked through the desert. Women and children are executed without hesitation and, when Chris is spotted in the distance, soldiers take off after him. It's clear they don't want people seeing what they're doing. He chimes in occasionally with helpful exposition as he's dictating articles, and yet, it's a wonder whether anyone who knows little about the events will actually be able to track what's going on in a meaningful way.</p>, <p>"The Promise" is infinitely more interested in the triangle, dropping the three leads into convenient situations to heighten the will they/won't they/can they/should they drama, which, frankly, becomes increasingly unsympathetic as the situation around them becomes more dire.</p>, <p>It's unfair to critique such an utterly sincere film that does contain some riveting action and acting and even might inspire some to learn more about this moment in history, but unfortunately, the story just doesn't live up to its grand ambitions.</p>, <p><strong>"The Promise"</strong> — 2 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating</strong>: PG-13 (for thematic material including war atrocities, violence and disturbing images, and for some sexuality)</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 2:14</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday</p>, <p><strong>RELATED STORIES:</strong></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-lost-city-z-mov-rev-0418-20170418-column.html">'The Lost City of Z': Charlie Hunnam leads Amazon expedition in spellbinding drama </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-norman-mov-rev-0417-20170417-column.html">'Norman' review: Richard Gere persuasive as a desperate New York 'consultant' </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-born-in-china-mov-rev-0420-20170420-story.html">'Born in China' review: Breathtaking scenes for nature lovers of any age</a></p>, <p>

Check out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.</p>][<p>Pierre Niney and Paula Beer in "Frantz."</p>, <p>Pierre Niney and Paula Beer in "Frantz."</p>, <p>In the opening moments of "Frantz," the latest intricately layered mystery from the French writer-director François Ozon, a German woman named Anna (Paula Beer) visits the grave of her fiancé, a soldier recently slain in the trenches of World War I. You can sense the war's immense reach in a few fleeting details — a man who whistles in Anna's direction is missing an arm — but also in the eerie quiet that has descended on the town's cobbled streets and in the somber cast of the movie's black-and-white images.</p>, <p>If you happen to have seen Ernst Lubitsch's "Broken Lullaby," the 1932 antiwar drama on which this new film is based, you might also sense something more: a curious and telling shift in perspective. Lubitsch's film, adapted from a play by Maurice Rostand, was a rare message picture from a director celebrated for his exquisite comic touch, unfolded through the eyes of a French veteran making an unexpected visit to the grieving loved ones of a dead German soldier.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>"Frantz" retains the earlier film's central premise and pacifist themes. A Parisian musician named Adrien Rivoire (Pierre Niney) has come to pay his respects to Dr. Hoffmeister (Ernst Stötzner) and his wife, Magda (Marie Gruber), and to share his memories of their fallen son, Frantz (played by Anton von Lucke in flashbacks). But this time, the story's moral and dramatic fulcrum is Anna, whose loving, protective attitude toward the Hoffmeisters, whom she regards as her own parents, is matched by her intense curiosity about this stranger in their midst.</p>, <p>The presence of a Frenchman in Germany so soon after the Great War does not go unremarked upon by Dr. Hoffmeister, who receives Adrien coldly at first, or by the glowering locals — one of whom, Kreutz (Johann von Bülow), wants to marry Anna himself. Adrien, for his part, is sympathetic but not entirely above suspicion. His recollections of many happy hours spent with Frantz in Paris before the war, visiting museums and playing the violin together, bring the Hoffmeisters no small measure of solace. But his sad eyes and halting, fearful demeanor seem to tell a darker, more unsettling story.</p>, <p>That story will not be revealed here, though Ozon, a master of misdirection and one of French cinema's most prolific chroniclers of gay desire, delights in raising the sort of romantic possibilities that are easier for an audience to countenance now than they were in 1919. More than once, "Frantz" hints that it will reveal itself as a homoerotic reworking of "Broken Lullaby." But Ozon has something simpler and no less intriguing up his sleeve.</p>, <p>One of the director's chief aims here — articulated with rueful clarity by Stötzner's sober-minded doctor — is to eliminate the distractions of nationalism and politics, and to remind his characters and his audience of the unimaginable suffering endured on both sides of the conflict. Not for nothing has Ozon rechristened the dead German soldier "Frantz," playfully evoking both his own name, François, and the nation of France itself: It's as if he were suggesting that the responsibility for a man's death does not always belong to his killer alone.</p>, <p>At one point, Ozon goes so far as to deconstruct a famous scene from "Casablanca," investing a moment of unambiguous moral triumph with undercurrents of menace and dread. By this point, "Frantz" has shaken off the last vestiges of "Broken Lullaby" and plunged forward in an entirely new narrative direction, one that begins when Anna boards a train for France and sets out to find answers of her own.</p>, <p>In doing so, she becomes the latest in a line of richly conflicted Ozon heroines — the women played by Charlotte Rampling in "Under the Sand" and Catherine Deneuve in "Potiche" come especially to mind — forced to confront impossible situations, usually set in motion by the men in their lives. Anna, reeling from devastation and disbelief to a startling rush of desire, doesn't know what either the past or the future holds, but she rises to the occasion with a bracing mix of clever calculation and pure instinct.</p>, <p>Something similar might be said of Ozon, whose work often attempts — not always successfully, but always impressively — to bridge the gap between style and feeling, between his flair for formal trickery and his desire to usher the viewer into a realm of unbridled emotion. In perhaps his most Ozonian gesture, he occasionally floods cinematographer Pascal Marti's monochrome palette with a sudden infusion of warm color, usually to signal a flashback to happier times. These moments are sometimes dreams, sometimes memories and sometimes beautiful lies, which is very much to the director's point.</p>, <p>One of the key questions he's asking here is about the moral necessity of telling a falsehood, particularly when the need to shield those already in mourning from further pain becomes its own moral imperative. "Frantz" achieves its own version of this paradox. It is a cunningly crafted fiction, full of visual artifice and narrative sleight-of-hand, that by the end could hardly feel more sincere.</p>, <p><em><a href="mailto:justin.chang@latimes.com">justin.chang@latimes.com</a></em></p>, <p><strong>"Frantz" </strong>— 3.5 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating</strong>: PG-13 (for thematic elements including brief war violence)</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 1:53</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday.

That's one of the most interesting things about it. Adjust your expectations accordingly.</p>, <p>This is the eighth in the franchise, which began with a relatively modest LA street-racing movie in 2001. The film just prior to the new one, "Furious 7," had a production budget of somewhere between $200 million and $250 million, and it was scaled like a berserk Bond film. Thanks to director James Wan and the cast, a lot of it worked. It was like playing Trackmania Turbo for two hours and 20 minutes, with a few pit stops for reminders of the importance of family.</p>, <p>It made $1.5 billion, which ensured the next film in the series would take things further into the realm of the huge and the stupid but, with luck and a little wit, good stupid, not stupid stupid.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>"The Fate of the Furious" illustrates the limits and hazards of multigenre blockbuster engineering. For an hour, director F. Gary Gray's pileup of gravity-free drag racing, supercool cyberterrorism, vehicular Ice Capades and World War III prevention program stays on the side of the good (or good enough) stupid. It's ridiculous but fun, as it careens from Havana to Berlin and icy, terrorist-ridden Russia played by Iceland, and a spit-ton of medium-grade digital effects.</p>, <p>But the second hour gets to be a real drag, and not the racing kind. Charlize Theron, glaring the glare of the truly mad and slightly bored, portrays the cyberloon who hijacks a nuclear submarine. If you babies are gonna whine about spoiler alerts, well, the sub's in the trailers. By that point in "The Fate of the Furious," the apocalyptic scale of the action runs out of tricks even before Hobbs, the Dwayne Johnson character, actually says: "Sorry, guys, I've got no more tricks left." The climax feels approximately 50 years long, and it makes the audience long for a simple scene, back in a garage somewhere, where everyone's standing around in tank tops.</p>, <p>Screenwriter Chris Morgan has written the majority of the previous "Furious" installments. In "The Fate of the Furious" Dom (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) are honeymooning in Cuba, where Dom runs afoul of Cipher (Theron), the blackmailing witch who forces Dom to turn against his gang and join her in her quest for world destabilization via nuclear launch codes, the three most hackneyed words in contemporary action filmmaking.</p>, <p>The gang, led by Johnson's biceps, is all here, be they frenemies (Jason Statham's ex-assassin) or softies (Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges and the IT help desk whiz of everyone's dreams, Nathalie Emmanuel). Kurt Russell's back as the man in the black suit with the job assignments and the chipper, I-love-my-job line readings. "Rule No. 1: Know your audience," he says at one point, and I suppose "The Fate of the Furious" knows that much, though I wonder if the massive global fan base wouldn't mind getting this franchise back to basics after this exercise in excess.</p>, <p>At one point Theron's villainess hacks into 1,000 midtown Manhattan vehicles, remotely, leading to cars plummeting out of fifth-story windows onto other cars, and an impromptu road rally where road rallies should not be held. The scene is tonally confusing: Is it supposed to be funny? Scary? Convincing? Or so video-gamey we're meant to enjoy the fraudulence? In many ways it's a scene emblematic of modern action movies. Just because you can design and execute such a sequence, that doesn't make it a good idea, or a satisfying series of images.</p>, <p>These days I find it difficult to relax into a scenario involving erratic adversaries hellbent on showing the world they mean business, come what may. This is the ultimate paradox with "The Fate of the Furious." Maybe a movie needs to be this expensively ridiculous to take your mind off the news. When your own nation's fate is in the hands of some furiously unpredictable characters, even a series devoted to vehicular mayhem, one of my favorite forms of movie mayhem, has a hard time saying it's all a joke. That said: It'll make its billion.

Occasionally employed New York City freelance writer Gloria, played by Hathaway, stumbles home from another night of drunken, half-remembered revelry. Her live-in boyfriend (Dan Stevens) has had it with her antics, and has packed her stuff. She heads back to her hometown and her conveniently empty parents' house, with a vague idea of getting her act together before taking it back on the road of her life.</p>, <p>Straight off she runs into her old pal Oscar, played by <a href="/topic/entertainment/television/jason-sudeikis-PECLB0000006670-topic.html" id="PECLB0000006670" title="Jason Sudeikis">Jason Sudeikis</a>, who clearly has been nursing a crush on Gloria for the better part of the years since elementary school. He gives her a job at his bar. After a late night with her new partners in alcohol (Tim Blake Nelson and Austin Stowell play Oscar's regulars), Gloria stumbles onto a playground at a park, goofs around and falls down, giggling.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>Meantime, on the other side of the world: A massive Godzilla-like <em>kaiju</em> is terrorizing Seoul. Somehow, according to "Colossal," that plus-sized destructive lizard is Gloria's avatar; when Hathaway's character enters the mysterious magical sandbox at the park, her stumblebum actions bring that monster to life.</p>, <p>From "King Kong" to the original, atomic age "Godzilla" onward, monster movies are metaphors unleashed. With "Colossal," writer-director Nacho Vigalondo treats Gloria's personal demons (alcohol, controlling and/or sinister men) as an opportunity for symbolic expression on a grandly fantastic scale. With a few trims the film could be entirely different and blandly realistic — messed-up protagonist returns to hometown for a bittersweet spiritual cleanse; we've seen a few indies along those lines, for sure, even if you don't include "Garden State."</p>, <p>But "Colossal" wants more. Vigalondo opens with a prologue introducing the marauding lizard of Seoul, so we know it's there, embedded in the narrative, waiting for a return. Vigalondo is equally interested in what lies beneath Oscar's seemingly good-guy facade. As his relationship with Gloria becomes infected with jealousy, long-simmering rage and general bad vibes, his own avatar enters the sandbox ring.</p>, <p>This is Vigalondo's fourth feature, and it shares some strengths with his first, the 2007 time-loop fantasy "Timecrimes." A small group of characters; a poker-faced approach to a ridiculous scenario; a protagonist internally at war; these are the building blocks of "Colossal." Hathaway is slyly funny and clearly pleased to be returning to a ground-level project along the lines of "Rachel Getting Married" (with different sorts of monsters). Sudeikis is effectively steely, though I keep waiting to be truly surprised by a single moment in a Sudeikis performance.</p>, <p>On some level I prefer my kaiju to mix it up with larger concerns and anxieties than two ordinary people's problems.

It comes from director Charlie Siskel, co-director of the excellent documentary-as-detective-story "Finding Vivian Maier." He's also the nephew of the late Tribune film critic after which the Film Center is named.</p>, <p>Siskel's subject here is William Powell, the man who wrote the notorious 1971 best-seller "The Anarchist Cookbook" in fit of brazen revolutionary defiance when he was an angry, disillusioned 19-year-old looking to make his mark. Culled from military manuals and other sources he found, among other places, in the New York Public Library, Powell offered a wealth of practical information about how make TNT and other explosives at home. Along with the recipes, "The Anarchist Cookbook" is packed with sentiments along the lines of: "Respect can only be earned by the spilling of blood."</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>He never lived it down. Powell earned relatively little money from the book's popularity. When copies of what he refers to, euphemistically, as "the cookbook" started turning up in the homes and apartments of terrorists and mass murderers, from Columbine to ISIS, the author's guilt and mortification pushed him away from America. For decades he and his wife worked around the world as educators and school administrators, focusing on children with special needs.</p>, <p>Siskel secured Powell's cooperation for a series of interviews at his home in rural France. Across four days in June 2015, the filmmaker questioned Powell on the touchy subject of the book, its bloody legacy and its author's culpability. Variously dodgy, wrenching, testy and sobering, Powell's answers often don't answer much. But Siskel keeps hammering on his subject, or target, until things get interesting.</p>, <p>At the Venice Film Festival last year, where Siskel's documentary made its world premiere, the filmmaker told me: "I have a lot of empathy for Bill. We all make youthful mistakes. His just happened to play out in a way most of ours don't — publicly, and with serious ramifications." Siskel said that going into the project, he hoped Powell would "be willing to look back at his life and face himself, by participating in this film." Things became "adversarial," he acknowledged, which is easy enough to discern in the finished product. "But he wanted to be pushed." Powell died the year after the interviews with Siskel.</p>, <p>"American Anarchist" has a tone that's at times not so much inquisitive as haranguing. In the years before his death Powell disowned the book, though if an author can be equal parts in denial and in confessional, that's the Powell we see here. Did "The Anarchist Cookbook" qualify as a legitimate if provocative publishing phenomenon, or was it simply an object lesson in the dangers of free speech? Did Powell take too long to speak and write about his regrets? There's a moment in "American Anarchist" when Ochan, Powell's wife, notes that "we all do dumb things. But not everyone prints them in a book."</p>, <p>Writers or not, we all carry our former selves inside of the people we became, and are becoming still. Siskel's movie — flawed, somewhat limited but never dull — makes Powell eat his words and then, in metaphorical terms, write the restaurant review.</p>, <p><em><a href="mailto:mjphillips@chicagotribune.com">mjphillips@chicagotribune.com</a></em></p>, <p><em>Twitter @phillipstribune</em></p>, <p><strong>"American Anarchist"</strong> — 3 stars</p>, <p><strong>No MPAA rating</strong></p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 1:20</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday (runs through April 20), Gene Siskel Film Center, 164 N.

It is also very much a movie-movie. Good-looking, finely acted, and well-told, director Lone Scherfig ("An Education") has made a charming, witty and romantic gem. It is "Shakespeare in Love" in World War II.</p>, <p>Adapted by Gaby Chiappe from the novel "Their Finest Hour and a Half" by Lissa Evans, "Their Finest" is centered on Catrin Cole (a luminous <a href="/topic/entertainment/gemma-arterton-PECLB0000007077-topic.html" id="PECLB0000007077" title="Gemma Arterton">Gemma Arterton</a>), a copywriter hired by the government to help write the "slop," or female dialogue, for a film meant to lift the spirits of a war-weary citizenry. She's a sort of proto-Peggy Olson whose talents and thick skin get her a place at the table alongside the men (although she is, they make sure to hammer home, paid less than her male counterparts).</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>Catrin takes the job out of necessity — her husband Ellis (Jack Huston) is a disabled and temperamental artist whose bleak industrial landscapes aren't selling and thus not bringing in any money for their rent. Although Ellis tries to talk her out of the work, Catrin comes alive in the writer's room, sparring with the egotistical lead writer Tom Buckley (Sam Claflin) as they try to meld minds to make a compelling story out of a newspaper account of twin sisters who stole their alcoholic father's boat to rescue soldiers from Dunkirk.</p>, <p>It's a relentlessly appealing take on the creative process, laced with humor and insight as Tom and Catrin bicker and banter about just who the hero should be (a man or the woman?), and how strictly they should adhere to the facts (not much, and, by the way, be sure to cut out the boring parts). What ends up being put into production, of course, is worlds away from reality, but there's a lovely discovery of the truth at the heart of the sisters' heroics that eventually makes it onto the screen.</p>, <p>Caiappe and Scherfig pack the film with fun side characters and pseudo showbiz insider jokes, like when they go out to the past-his-prime actor Ambrose Hilliard (Bill Nighy, always the scene stealer) for the "corpse role" of the drunken father who's described as being a "shipwreck of a man" who is in his 60s but "looks older." Ambrose of course thinks he's being considered for the part of the hero and is stunned to realize otherwise.</p>, <p>They're also, late in the game, instructed that they have to cast an American in the film because, in addition to British propaganda, the government now needs this film to persuade the U.S. to help out with the war efforts. The star they have in mind is a real Air Force pilot, Carl Lundbeck (<a href="/topic/entertainment/jake-lacy-PECLB00014825-topic.html" id="PECLB00014825" title="Jake Lacy">Jake Lacy</a>) — a Captain America type with golden locks and a million dollar smile. You can guess how that goes.</p>, <p>But just because some of the beats are predictable doesn't mean that "Their Finest" is ineffective — quite the opposite. The elegantly composed script even begins to mirror the film within the film as the romantic tension grows between Catrin and Tom. Both need an ending, but what will it be?</p>, <p>Claflin in particular is a standout, ironically because he's been made to look less glamorous than usual. His mousy brown hair, rounded specs and layers of tweeds and wool let his real acting heft shine through. You actually believe he's the underdog.</p>, <p>Without giving too much away, there is a beat (you'll know it when it comes) that might sour things for some audiences, but it's not enough to destroy all the good that's there. Inspiring, funny and genuinely romantic, "Their Finest" is a solid, refreshing crowd-pleaser.</p>, <p><strong>"Their Finest"</strong> — 3.5 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating</strong>: R (for some language and a scene of sexuality)</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 1:57</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday</p>, <p><strong>RELATED STORIES:</strong></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-fate-of-furious-mov-rev-0412-20170412-column.html">'Fate of the Furious' review: Starts out well, in its ridiculous way, but can't keep pace </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-colossal-mov-rev-0410-20170410-column.html">''Colossal' review: Her inner monster unleashed, Anne Hathaway stomps on expectation </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-queen-of-desert-mov-rev-0410-20170412-story.html">'Queen of the Desert' review: Nicole Kidman squandered in sappy biopic of English scholar-explorer</a></p>, <p>

Lawrence in Werner Herzog's "Queen of the Desert." </p>, <p>The subject of "Queen of the Desert," writer-director Werner Herzog's first narrative feature since 2009, is Gertrude Bell, an Englishwoman who, in the years after World War I, used her expertise in Arab affairs and culture to help Winston Churchill negotiate the redrawn borders of the modern Middle East.</p>, <p>Although the German filmmaker has been turning his hand almost exclusively to documentary lately, with such nonfiction meditations on deep subjects as "Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World," the real-life Gertrude (here played by <a href="/topic/entertainment/nicole-kidman-PECLB002788-topic.html" id="PECLB002788" title="Nicole Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a>) makes a worthy subject for fact-based drama. Scholar, mountain-climber, fearless explorer and feminist ahead of her time, she lived a life worth letting the world in on.</p>, <p>"This is her story," reads the on-screen title that introduces "Desert," before launching into a tale devoted — at least for the film's first half-hour — to her abortive romance with a low-level diplomat in the British Embassy in Tehran, where Gertrude had gone to get away from the stultifying mores of England. (Seems an odd choice, but there you have it.)</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>It's another odd choice to devote so much time to a love story, in a movie that ostensibly was made to celebrate the accomplishments of its subject, and not just her love life. Yet another questionable decision is casting <a href="/topic/entertainment/james-franco-PECLB001786-topic.html" id="PECLB001786" title="James Franco">James Franco</a> as that lover, Henry Cadogan. Franco looks way too young compared with Kidman, for one thing, and his British accent comes and goes, like the sirocco.

Shots of her using surveyors' instruments and taking photographs of the desert, where she blusters, bribes and sweet-talks her way out of various pickles with belligerent Bedouins, are mixed in with way too many slow-motion shots of pretty scenery and scenes of Gertrude writing, perusing and reciting letters to and from her beloved Henry, and later to and from her replacement beloved, the very married British Army officer Charles "Richard" Doughty-Wiley (Damian Lewis).</p>, <p>Though Kidman delivers a workmanlike performance, the story manages to be soppy and ploddingly dull, told via a screenplay that drives home the fact that it's not really about momentous events, but momentous feelings. "My heart belongs to no one now but the desert," says Gertrude, after her father has forbidden her to marry Henry. Later, as the soon-to-be-crowned King Faisal I of Iraq (Younes El Bouab), tells Gertrude, "No one in the Western world knows the heart of the Bedouin better than you."</p>, <p>For a movie with so much heart, "Queen of the Desert" is a remarkably bloodless enterprise.</p>, <p><strong>"Queen of the Desert"</strong> — 1.5 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating:</strong> PG-13 (contains brief nudity, sensuality and mild rude language)</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 2:09</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday</p>, <p><strong>RELATED STORIES:</strong></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-fate-of-furious-mov-rev-0412-20170412-column.html">'Fate of the Furious' review: Starts out well, in its ridiculous way, but can't keep pace </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-colossal-mov-rev-0410-20170410-column.html">''Colossal' review: Her inner monster unleashed, Anne Hathaway stomps on expectation </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-tommys-honour-mov-rev-0411-20170413-story.html">'Tommy's Honour' review: Family drama behind the founding father of golf</a></p>, <p>

Check out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.</p>][<p>Jack Lowden in "Tommy's Honour"</p>, <p>Jack Lowden in "Tommy's Honour"</p>, <p>The founding father of golf, Old Tom Morris, designed some of the world's first courses, but it was his son, Tommy, who mastered them. Though he only lived to the age of 24, Young Tom helped to define the game as it is known today, rising above his station as the son of a lower-class Scottish caddy to become one of the sport's first professional stars. The way "Tommy's Honour" tells it, Old Tom (who is played by that master of stoicism Peter Mullan in stiff tweed suits and a wild-bramble beard) didn't much approve of his son's desire to rise above his station, making for a standard-issue father/son clash-of-wills drama, brought to the screen by Jason Connery, who's had his own challenges filling dad's shoes.</p>, <p>"Tommy's Honour" premiered at the Palm Springs Film Festival, where an audience of graying golf enthusiasts tore themselves away from the fairway to enjoy this early chapter in the sport's history. While not as primitive as "The Flintstones" cartoons have imagined Stone Age golf, the version seen here is a far rougher sport, played with handmade balls and wooden clubs on fields of coarse grass so different from the manicured lawns to which modern players are accustomed that the film's intrepid locations scouts must have been hard-pressed to find suitable courses.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>But the real discovery here is Jack Lowden, a fresh-faced young stage actor who plays Tommy Morris with the dashing self-confidence of a 1920s Hollywood screen idol — though the film takes place roughly half a century earlier. Like the film's director, Tommy grew up on a golf course, and it's assumed by the uptight club members at St Andrews Links (as embodied by a snooty, red-suited Sam Neill) that the young man will become a caddy like his father. But Tommy has no interest in spending his days lugging clubs and teeing up balls for his betters, and devises a plan to play for money.</p>, <p>Sporting gentlemen had already been placing bets on Tommy and his father, who competed as a team, settling for tips whenever they won. It's a recurring source of tension that Old Tom was a natural with long shots, but lousy on the putting green, and like one of those would-be rockers in a 1960s-set British music biopic, Tommy couldn't suppress his rebellious streak, ultimately insisting that the gamblers pay him to play.</p>, <p>Today, golf stars are groomed from an early age, à la Tiger Woods, and though Tommy clearly spends most of his free time golfing, his father constantly reminds him of his place. That makes for a rather predictable standoff, accompanied by a parallel stalemate with his mother when Tommy insists on marrying an older woman with a scandalous past (Ophelia Lovibond). Still, there's something universal enough in these struggles that the scenes prove effective, despite their familiarity.</p>, <p>In fact, these interpersonal moments prove far more compelling than the golf, enriched as they are by the chemistry between the leads. It helps that Mullan isn't playing a monster (as he terrifyingly did in "Tyrannosaur"); rather, he's a gruff pragmatist bound by the rules of an earlier generation, ultimately humbled by the tragedy that awaits his son.</p>, <p>While there's a certain charm in seeing these early sportsmen dressed as though ready for mass (no kilts, alas), the golf scenes are undone by the fact that no one can actually swing a club. For some roles, actors will learn to play an instrument of master a manual skill, but there's none of that authenticity here. Instead, Connery has gone back in post and unconvincingly inserted digital balls, which defy the laws of physics as blatantly as the CG goo in Disney's "Flubber." The strategy robs us of what little thrill golf has to offer, whether spectating live or on TV, as impossible shots remain precisely that: impossible.</p>, <p>Thankfully, Connery has kept the story's human side grounded in the real world, and those are the only stakes that matter.</p>, <p><strong>"Tommy's Honour"</strong> — 2.5 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating</strong>: PG (for thematic elements, some suggestive material, language and smoking)</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 1:57</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday</p>, <p><strong>RELATED STORIES:</strong></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-fate-of-furious-mov-rev-0412-20170412-column.html">'Fate of the Furious' review: Starts out well, in its ridiculous way, but can't keep pace </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-colossal-mov-rev-0410-20170410-column.html">''Colossal' review: Her inner monster unleashed, Anne Hathaway stomps on expectation </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-queen-of-desert-mov-rev-0410-20170412-story.html">'Queen of the Desert' review: Nicole Kidman squandered in sappy biopic of English scholar-explorer</a></p>, <p>

While Zola "sells out" and becomes a celebrated novelist, Cézanne sticks to a style that would not be fully appreciated until well after his death, making for a series of strained encounters as the increasingly disheveled artist relies on his old pal for encouragement over the years.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>Brought to handsome yet melancholy life by writer-director Danièle Thompson ("Avenue Montaigne"), the film works best for those who weren't aware that Cézanne and Zola shared such a bond, as opposed to French culture hounds already familiar the connection, which inspired Zola's novel "L'œuvre," whose tortured protagonist he based on the painter. The book plays a key role in the movie, since Cézanne was evidently none too flattered with the portrait and felt that Zola was exploiting their friendship — though in retrospect, the author's admiration is clear, revealing a deep respect for a creative spirit who resisted the tastes du jour, and achieved artistic immortality in the process.</p>, <p>A veteran of the French filmmaking establishment, Thompson was Oscar-nominated for co-writing the taboo-confounding 1975 romance "Cousin Cousine," and who has specialized in rendering complicated and potentially controversial relationships in perfectly accessible terms. Here, her idea of dramatic turbulence is to tell the story out of order, jumping back and forth in time, while offsetting the perfectly lit widescreen beauty of each scene with an ever-so-slightly unstable handheld shooting style. Visually, the approach makes for a subtle, almost-subliminal attempt to shake things up, but the movie remains entirely too traditional, despite these touches.</p>, <p>Perhaps too much time has elapsed since the 1860s, when the story begins, to do justice to Cézanne's renegade spirit. A character can only seem so revolutionary when dressed in straw hats and suspenders, and even at his most disheveled (disguised beneath long hair and a woolly black beard), Gallienne makes for a thoroughly unconvincing slob. He's a fine actor, but no force of nature, and the role seems to call for someone fiery enough to have gone his entire life without yielding to social conventions.</p>, <p>As written, Cézanne is a headstrong, hot-blooded lothario, constantly chasing women (an early conquest, played by Alice Pol, later agrees to marry Zola, complicating the dynamic between the two men considerably) and complaining about the lack of respect he gets from his peers. Meanwhile, Zola had the good fortune of being recognized as a genius during his own lifetime. With such acceptance comes the ability to settle into a state of comfortable domesticity in his country mansion — though in light of his activism, it's hard to imagine him being quite the stuffy, pipe-smoking prig of Canet's portrayal. Meanwhile, Cézanne scrapes by in a dingy Paris flat paid for by his wealthy friend, selling his paintings for a fraction of their worth (in one particularly depressing scene, his dealer/supplier shows Cézanne a still life from which he has cut a small square-shaped hole in the canvas, selling just the apple to a stingy client).</p>, <p>The most interesting aspects of Cézanne's struggle are better captured in other works, most notably Ross King's "The Judgment of Paris," which depicts the rift between the Impressionists and the French Academy that supplies some of the film's most interesting scenes — and explains how a painter of horses named Ernest Meissonier (whom you've most likely never heard of) was prized above all the artists whose work now sells for millions, but were rejected by the Academy for the annual salons at the time. Cézanne's crime was painting loose, non-realistic landscape portraits en plein aire. Ironically, this very act of rebellion feels by far the tamest thing in the entire movie, which captures the splendor, if none of the defiance in this simple act, rendering scenes of the artist hiking across picturesque hilltops with his easel on par with idle afternoons spent tooling around in a rowboat with his buddy Zola.</p>, <p><strong>"Cezanne et Moi"</strong> — 2 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating</strong>: R (for language, sexual references and nudity)</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 1:54</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday</p>, <p><strong>RELATED STORIES:</strong></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-fate-of-furious-mov-rev-0412-20170412-column.html">'Fate of the Furious' review: Starts out well, in its ridiculous way, but can't keep pace </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-colossal-mov-rev-0410-20170410-column.html">''Colossal' review: Her inner monster unleashed, Anne Hathaway stomps on expectation </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-queen-of-desert-mov-rev-0410-20170412-story.html">'Queen of the Desert' review: Nicole Kidman squandered in sappy biopic of English scholar-explorer</a></p>, <p>

But Papa Smurf transformed her into a force for good (in the process changing her from brown-haired to blond and, incidentally, sending a troubling message to dark-haired little girls everywhere).</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>The plot of "The Lost Village" exposes its own lack of character development. As it gets underway, with the Smurfs trying to prevent Gargamel from capturing Smurfs to turn them into gold, Smurfette is shown embarking on a journey of self-discovery to figure out what, precisely, she's made for. Is she just a pint-size version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl, the kind of cute female character, best epitomized by Zooey Deschanel, who exists as nothing more than an emotional delivery system — whether of support or rejection — for male characters?</p>, <p>The answer lies, sort of, in the Lost Village, an all-female enclave populated by Smurfs with such names as Smurfwillow (<a href="/topic/entertainment/julia-roberts-PECLB003553-topic.html" id="PECLB003553" title="Julia Roberts">Julia Roberts</a>), which, for the most part, do not describe their character or vocation at all. <a href="/topic/entertainment/michelle-rodriguez-PECLB0000008156-topic.html" id="PECLB0000008156" title="Michelle Rodriguez">Michelle Rodriguez</a>'s warrior Smurf, Smurfstorm, is the sole exception.</p>, <p>In an attempt to compensate for Smurfette's historical lack of identity, the film delivers a lesson — spoiler alert for anyone reading this who is still awake — that she can be anyone she wants to be. Meanwhile, the male Smurf population remains, presumably, trapped by the limitations of their names.</p>, <p>The movie is not without its imaginative pleasures, including Snappy Bug, a ladybug whose underside doubles as a camera, and whose legs stamp out photographic prints, like a dot-matrix printer. Only Clumsy Smurf undergoes any real character development when he finds that he isn't, er, clumsy with everything.</p>, <p>But the garish pastels of the Lost Village, while they introduce us to such delights as wondrous dragonflies, aggressively self-pollinating flowers and glow-in-the-dark bunnies, come off like some kind of family-friendly psychedelic trip (one that could only have been envisioned by the kitschy artist Thomas Kinkade, the "Painter of Light").</p>, <p>Children may well find all this delightful — along with any adults who have managed to retain the requisite level of childlike wonder and innocence.

Stone" </p>, <p>A scene from the documentary "All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F. Stone" </p>, <p>"All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F. Stone" is an urgent and fascinating documentary. Even if you belong to the choir it's preaching to, it has the rare distinction of being a movie you can agree and argue with at the same time. The title makes it sound like a portrait of I.F. Stone, the trend-setting investigative journalist (he died in 1989) who in his highly influential self-published newsletter, I.F. Stone's Weekly, tweaked and railed against the sins of the U.S. government — and the mainstream media, though back then it was known simply as, you know, journalism — from the early '50s through the early '70s. Stone, you could argue, was the missing link between Thomas Paine and the Internet. "All Governments Lie" treats him as the original political blogger, though it doesn't offer much more than a thumbnail sketch of Stone. His gadfly spirit hovers over the movie, but his life and work occupy maybe 10 minutes of it.</p>, <p>We see Stone in clips, where he looks like a jovial owl in Coke-bottle glasses, wearing the outfits of a portly professor, and he explains his reporting methods, which were so unsexy at the time that they now seem completely exotic. He didn't call government officials, and he wasn't even accredited to attend a White House press conference. Instead, he went into back rooms and pored through documents and transcripts to learn what was really going on.</p>, <p>The result? In 1964, when President Lyndon Johnson and his Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, engineered the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the two contrived acts of North Vietnamese "aggression" that were used as a trigger to launch the war in Vietnam, the mainstream media didn't discover or acknowledge the truth — that the U.S. had misrepresented the incident — for years. But I.F. Stone got to that truth the week after it happened, one of countless scoops he nailed while under the mainstream radar. In the movie, Michael Moore compares Stone to Toto in "The Wizard of Oz," tugging back the curtain to reveal the power elite hiding behind their image of authority. It's a comparison that Moore takes comfort in, because it means that we don't have to be so frightened of what's behind the curtain.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>I.F. Stone, known as "Izzy" (the perfect rock-star-of-dweeb-investigators nickname), was one of the great journalists of the 20th century, and he deserves a movie of his own. But "All Governments Lie" is mostly devoted to the pluck and courage of his present-day inheritors. It's a portrait of roughly half a dozen independent reporters, a few of whom have achieved notoriety, who are carrying on the tradition of renegade muckraking that Stone almost singlehandedly put on the map in the postwar era. The Intercept, an online investigative site, was launched in 2014 by Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras (from "Citizenfour") along with Jeremy Scahill, with financial backing from the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Greenwald calls it "The spirit of I.F. Stone, but funded with $250 million," and the site has done a great deal to unearth the new surveillance security state, including a story we see about the use of German satellite towers to coordinate assassinations by U.S. drones.</p>, <p>The movie tips its hat to people like Amy Goodman, whose global news program "Democracy Now!" straddles radio, TV, and the Web, and John Carlos Frey, who we see reporting a cataclysmic story about 200 Mexican immigrants whose bodies were discovered in mass graves in Brooks County, Texas, 70 miles from the border. Mostly, though, "All Governments Lie" focuses on big game like the rah-rah run-up to the Iraq War, which it uses to illustrate the thesis that the mainstream media — all of it — has become a bought-and-paid-for tool of government and corporate power.</p>, <p>On dark days, there's a good case to be made for that. The propaganda that paved the road to the war in Iraq (the acceptance of WMDs, the Colin Powell testimony, even the preposterously alleged Saddam/Al-Qaeda "connection") went, for the most part, egregiously unquestioned by the mainstream media, notably The New York Times. That has now made the Iraq War drumbeat a kind of Rosetta Stone for independent journalism. Yet as you watch "All Governments Lie," the anti-mainstream-media arguments are repeated so often, and so broadly, that they become a kind of catechism: All media is controlled by advertisers. Reporters aren't allowed to question The System. Greed, corruption and government-sanctioned criminality are shrouded in narcotizing fake news. There's truth to all of this — especially if you tend to get your news from network TV. But if you'd just arrived from Mars and watched "All Governments Lie," you'd come away thinking that independent journalism in America was the only kind of journalism you could trust. And that, to put it mildly, is an overstatement.</p>, <p>Directed by Fred Peabody in a mode of lively documentary prose, with Oliver Stone as one of its executive producers, "All Governments Lie" suggests that the kind of fearless independent reporting practiced by I.F. Stone is alive and well — and that if anything, it's gaining traction. The film's arguments about the blizzard of fake news (the Kardashians, etc.) that swirls around us are undeniable. At the same time, the fragmentation of our attention spans — and the general dislocation from reality — that has led to a society engulfed by conspiracy theory, not to mention an "outsider" president, can't be blamed on mainstream media. The problem is more profound than that.</p>, <p><strong>"All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F.

But this contrived mashup of "Proof" (earth-shaking algorithms), "Kramer vs. Kramer" (nerve-wracking custody battles) and "Little Man Tate" <em>really</em> isn't much.</p>, <p>Screenwriter Tom Flynn ("Watch It") sets his tale in a breezy coastal Florida town. Freelance boat mechanic Frank, played by Chris "Captain America" Evans, home-schools his niece, Mary (Mckenna Grace). The kid's a prodigy, particularly in mathematics; her mother (Frank's sister), now deceased, devoted her suffocating life to mathematics, at the fierce urging of Mary's Boston grandmother (Lindsay Duncan).</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>Frank decides 6-year-old Mary needs friends her own age, so he enrolls her at the local public school. (Octavia Spencer struggles to activate the bleh role of Mary's neighbor, occasional caregiver and best pal.) At school, the girl's teacher (Jenny Slate, doing some of the least conspicuous and most effective acting of her career) realizes Mary's exceptional gifts. She also realizes Frank's laconic charms as the local "quiet, damaged hot guy," as she and a female colleague refer to him.</p>, <p>Slate's scenes with Evans, her former real-life romantic partner, feel easy-breathing and lived-in. Most of "Gifted" strains to catch its breath. The bulk of it deals with questions of Mary's destiny. Should she give up life with her uncle, and their one-eyed cat, Fred, for the unknown? A dream adoptive couple appears on the scene; so does Mary's birth father, whom she has never met. Frank blames his mother, eager to steer her granddaughter's life, for the death of Mary's mother.

If that sounds like a qualified endorsement, you're reading me loud and clear.</p>, <p>Director Zach Braff, best known for "Scrubs," works from a script by Theodore Melfi ("St. Vincent," "Hidden Figures"). With their approximately $45,000 annual steel mill pensions frozen and presumed lost, owing to manufacturing moving to Vietnam, retirees Joe (Michael Caine), Willie (Morgan Freeman) and Al (Alan Arkin) are saddled with money problems in the extreme. (Millions may watch "Going in Style" and, at least for a moment, think: <em>Must be nice to have a pension to lose</em>.) During a testy meeting with his local loan officer about an imminent home foreclosure, Joe witnesses a deft, bloodless bank robbery and gets an idea. Why not go gangster himself and pull off his own heist, with the help of his pals?</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>"Going in Style" spins forward, as the not-so-terrible trio first attempts some medium-weight shoplifting (Ann-Margret pops in as the grocery store employee with the hots for Al). With the help of a local pet store owner (John Ortiz), they montage their way through a month's worth of robbery planning. Christopher Lloyd, among other character actors, appears as a delusional regular at the VFW hall where the gang hangs out, dreaming of a better third act than the one fate, and corporate America, has dealt them.</p>, <p>I hadn't seen writer-director Martin Brest's original "Going in Style" since it came out nearly 40 years ago, and a revisit was frankly astonishing. Brest had the sense, the taste and the temperament to allow George Burns, Art Carney and Lee Strasberg to play their scenes, many of them achingly sad, at a relaxed tempo. There's hardly any rim-shot humor or concessions to perceived audience taste circa '79.</p>, <p>Alan Arkin, from left, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine star in the codger-heist heartwarmer remake “Going in Style.”</p>, <p>Alan Arkin, from left, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine star in the codger-heist heartwarmer remake “Going in Style.”</p>, <p>Braff's remake is a lot pushier, and more determinedly ingratiating. Arkin gets the most from the material, simply by not falling prey to the obvious rhythms in Melfi's screenplay. Too often the movie ignores what it has right in the foreground, in its favor. There's an Arkin/Ann-Margret duet on "Hallelujah I Love Her So" that gets lost in a chaotically edited action sequence, for example. Braff's approach is the bigger-equals-funnier mode, and while that mode has its commercial upside, the downside is a delightful hambone such as Lloyd working 200 percent harder than needed.</p>, <p>The same cannot be said of the stars. Caine, Freeman and Arkin redeem a lot of the movie, and interesting faces keep turning up, such as Matt Dillon (as a dumb/smart hybrid of an FBI agent), Joey King (as Joe's granddaughter) and Maria Dizzia (too-briefly seen as Joe's daughter). Freeman is now 79; Arkin, 83; Caine, 84. Collectively these performers have learned more about what works with an audience, and how to serve a character, than can be measured. "Going in Style" stays in the safe zone every second, nervous about risking any audience discomfort, as opposed to Brest's quietly nervy ode to old age and its discontents. Times change. If Braff's film is a hit, it'll be because the three headliners have more or less refused to change with them.</p>, <p><em>Michael Phillips is a Tribune critic.</em></p>, <p><em>Twitter @phillipstribune</em></p>, <p><strong>"Going in Style"</strong> — 2.5 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating</strong>: PG-13 (for drug content, language and some suggestive material)</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 1:36</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Thursday evening</p>, <p><strong>RELATED STORIES:</strong></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-gifted-mov-rev-0403-20170403-column.html">'Gifted' review: A well-acted but contrived weepie starring Chris Evans, Jenny Slate </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-your-name-mov-rev-0405-20170406-story.html">'Your Name' review: Body-swapping teens look for love in entertaining Japanese anime </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-ghost-in-shell-mov-rev-0330-20170330-column.html">'Ghost in the Shell' review: Scarlett Johansson gives life to controversial adaptation</a></p>, <p>

An endearingly loopy mix of time-travel, body-swap and disaster-movie ingredients that was a massive hit in its native Japan, this unconventional romance hails from the imagination of Makoto Shinkai, a talented up-and-coming animation director who launched his career with the ultra-indie "Voices of a Distant Star," and who has dedicated himself to creating some of the country's most stunning anime ever since. .</p>, <p>Because neither Newton's Laws nor traditional genre rules apply here, "Your Name's" fantastical premise skips the usual love-at-first-sight cliche and introduces its would-be couple — big-city Tokyo teen Taki (voiced by Ryûnosuke Kamiki) and provincial schoolgirl Mitsuha (Mone Kamishiraishi) — under far more intimate circumstances: Taki's first impression of Mitsuha is how strange it is to suddenly awaken as a girl. So, rather than worrying about all the things that could potentially come between them, as we normally would in a romantic drama, here, the suspense hinges on whether these two characters will succeed in figuring out who one another actually is — and from there, why the cosmos have seen fit to connect them in the first place.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>Initially, Taki and Mitsuha can't even be sure the body-swapping is actually happening, mistaking days spent in a complete stranger's skin as vivid dreams — that is, until their friends' and family's reactions reveal that while they've each been away, someone else has been eating breakfast, riding the bus/subway and going to school in their place. Of course, neither has any clue how to handle being thrust into the other's life, surrounded by strangers in a city far removed from their own home. It takes a few such switches before they even learn to communicate, and longer still before they discover how to use the arrangement to their mutual advantage.</p>, <p>This playful setup gives way to a far more elaborate supernatural scenario, one that exploits a feeling not unlike déjà vu, only stronger, as neither character can seem to hold onto the memory of what they did while out-of-body for long. Meanwhile, the puzzle becomes increasingly clear to us, the audience, as we gradually come to understand the significance of a gorgeous atmospheric condition teased in the film's opening seconds.</p>, <p>Audiences would be hard-pressed to find any animator capable of rendering more beautiful skies, or landscapes, than Shinkai. Among the innovations of Shinkai's self-taught, all-digital approach are the director's signature hyper-realistic backgrounds, which are more than mere paintings, but shimmer and change perspective in ways that the old cel-based techniques never allowed. In "Your Name," that allows for the film's most breathtaking moment: Like Richard Dreyfuss, carving Devil's Rock out of his mashed potatoes in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," Taki has taken to sketching what looks like a giant round lake formed by the crater of a meteoric impact. For years, he hasn't known what to make of these drawings, since physically speaking, he's never so much as ventured beyond Tokyo. But once he finally musters the momentum to investigate his time spent as Mitsuha, the search leads him to the lake in question, which has dramatically changed shape since the last time he saw it.</p>, <p>Only then does he realize that his old body-swapping buddy may have been the victim of a long-ago comet strike, and through a series of time-travel paradoxes that never quite make sense, he spends the rest of the movie trying to save her so that one day they can be together — the tragedy being that even if he succeeds, there's no guarantee he'll even be able to remember anything about it, much less the name of the stranger with whom he shared this vicarious adventure. Meanwhile, this vividly realized and emotionally satisfying feature ought to make Shinkai a household name.</p>, <p><strong>"Your Name"</strong> — 3 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating</strong>: PG (for thematic elements, suggestive content, brief language, and smoking)</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 1:46</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday at the Music Box Theatre, 3733 N.

A paradox!</p>, <p>In director Rupert Sanders' darkly imaginative new film, Johansson plays the Major, a member of the cyberterrorism law enforcement division trying to keep hackers from sabotaging the artificial intelligence wonders manufactured by Hanka Robotics. The shell of the title, for the edification of my fellow manga know-nothings, is the sleek android body, capable of amazements and really slick combat moves. The ghost is the human part, the soul, or at the very least the functioning human brain placed inside the shell.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>The star of the movie is the box office insurance. Here's why the casting controversy isn't a deal breaker to me. For one thing, director Sanders' on-screen ensemble ranges all over the globe, from France's Juliette Binoche (as the surgeon overseeing the AI patch-ups) and Romanian Anamaria Marinca (as a fellow tech specialist who never puts down her cigarette in the lab) to Danish star Pilou Asbaek (as the Major's dog-loving comrade) to Japanese actor-director "Beat" Takeshi Kitano, supercool as he mows down adversaries.</p>, <p>For another, "Ghost in the Shell" owes a great deal to previous incarnations of the material, including the 1995 animated feature. But it actually feels like an organic entity, which is an odd thing to say about a movie about robots and humans with robotic upgrades.</p>, <p>Scarlett Johansson plays a human/robot hybrid member of a cyberterrorism unit in “Ghost in the Shell.”</p>, <p>Scarlett Johansson plays a human/robot hybrid member of a cyberterrorism unit in “Ghost in the Shell.”</p>, <p>And this: Johansson, known to global audiences for many roles but mainly as Black Widow in the ongoing "Avengers" destruction larks, has by now perfected her unblinking, unsettling, uncanny way of creating nonhumans with a human pulse. In director Jonathan Glazer's mind bender "Under the Skin" (2013), Johansson played an extraterrestrial conducting the world's grimmest speed-dating exercise. In the less interesting, more commercial "Lucy" (2014), from Luc Besson, she transcended previously known human limits of intelligence, as was the case with the Siri-like voice she provided in Spike Jonze's marvelous "Her."</p>, <p>"Ghost in the Shell" gives her a chance to operate a female-driven action franchise, and yes, casting Johansson surely Westernizes the project to a substantial degree. That fact is complicated by the film, and the performance, being good.</p>, <p>We're in "New Port City," sometime in the future, and the urban Asian metropolis recalls elements of "Metropolis" (densely snaking roadways to nowhere); "Blade Runner" (relentless advertising signage, this time entirely digital, so that massive digital fish appear to swim amid pedestrians on the street); and early 21st-century Tokyo, pumped up and packed with technology both alluring and suffocating.</p>, <p>The movie's half police procedural, half personal investigation, as the Major gradually discovers the truth about her human past. There's a hacker (Michael Carmen Pitt) whose acts of sabotage serve as a warning against Hanka's insidious societal influence. Tracking him down leads the Major deeper into her own mysteries.</p>, <p>This isn't jokey, quippy science fiction; true to the source material, it's fairly grave about the implications of an android-dominated culture, though of course "Ghost in the Shell" is also about giant mecha spiders equipped with machine guns. I got a little itchy and a mite restless during this routine action climax. But until then I was happily enveloped by the visual world created by director Sanders, his cinematographer Jess Hall and the production designer Jan Roelfs. If you want a list of comics-derived spectacles less successful and worthy than this one, "Suicide Squad" heads the list. And that's the only list it'll ever head.</p>, <p><em>Michael Phillips is a Tribune critic.</em></p>, <p><em><a href="mailto:mjphillips@chicagotribune.com">mjphillips@chicagotribune.com</a></em></p>, <p><em>Twitter @phillipstribune</em></p>, <p><strong>"Ghost in the Shell" </strong>— 3 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating</strong>: PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi violence, suggestive content and some disturbing images)</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 1:46</p>, <p><strong>Opened</strong>: Thursday evening</p>, <p><strong>RELATED STORIES:</strong></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-zookeepers-wife-mov-rev-0328-20170329-story.html">'The Zookeeper's Wife' review: Jessica Chastain commands the screen with portrayal of WWII hero</a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-boss-baby-mov-rev-0329-20170329-story.html">'Boss Baby' review: Fun for parents, maybe not so much for kids</a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-wilson-mov-rev-0320-20170320-column.html">'Wilson' review: Woody Harrelson doesn't do justice to Daniel Clowes' graphic novel </a></p>, <p>

It's not only his choreography that can get spiky.</p>, <p>Most of the dances in this 2015 film were created for Tel Aviv's Batsheva Dance Company, which Naharin has led since 1990. Details are filled out with childhood home movies, archival dance footage and the recollections of others. We see Naharin as a freewheeling kibbutz kid, as an athletic teen and as a young, searching dancer in New York City.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>Naharin went there to work with Martha Graham's company and to study ballet. He also met Mari Kajiwara, a star with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater who later became his collaborator and wife, eventually moving back to Israel with him — not an easy choice for the native New Yorker.</p>, <p>Former dancers and teachers remark on the demanding, difficult, selfish, gifted and irresistible fellow that Naharin, now 64, has always been, defying norms (and, at least once, the Israeli government over an issue of costume censorship).</p>, <p>Gaga looks like fun, but the soul-revealing "Mr. Gaga" makes clear the sacrifice Naharin's dedication has exacted from family and dancers alike.</p>, <p><em>Gaga dance teacher Anna Long will perform a dance and participate in a discussion after the 7:15 p.m. screening Friday</em><em>.</em></p>, <p><strong>"Mr. Gaga"</strong> — 3.5 stars</p>, <p><strong>No MPAA rating</strong></p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 1:42</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday at the Music Box, Theatre, 3733 N.

Babies are like bosses, but more satirically, bosses are like babies, right?</p>, <p>That metaphor is explored in Marla Frazee's children's book, with a boss baby outfitted in a suit, complete with buttoned bottom flap, and now that's been transported to the screen with Alec Baldwin voicing the titular boss.</p>, <p>In theory, the idea seems about as interesting as "Baby Geniuses," but in execution, the film is surprisingly fun and clever. Written by Michael McCullers, it's almost too clever for its own good — only adults are going to the appreciate nuances of the jokes and wordplay about corporate middle-management culture, with all of its memos and water coolers.</p>, <p>A scene from the movie "The Boss Baby"</p>, <p>A scene from the movie "The Boss Baby"</p>, <p>That content is offset with a wild and creative visual design. The film is directed by Tom McGrath, who directed the "Madagascar" and "Megamind" films, and got his start in animation on "The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show." There's a fluidness to the action sequences, especially the imaginative fantasy sequences of young Tim Templeton (Miles Bakshi), the boy whose home the Boss Baby invades. It's a visual treat from start to finish, expansive in scope and multitudinous in its design influences.</p>, <p>Though Frazee's book offers the metaphor of the Boss Baby, McCullers fleshes out a full action-adventure story for Boss Baby and Tim. Turns out this Boss Baby isn't here to stay, he's just on a mission from BabyCorp to infiltrate PuppyCo. via his new parents and investigate their new product launch. Turns out BabyCorp is concerned that their market share of parental love is tipping too far into the puppy realm, and they need an ambitious young executive to turn things around.</p>, <p>But this corporate scheming is simply the backdrop for what becomes a sibling love story. Tim and Boss Baby start out as rivals, especially when he discovers that his little be-suited younger brother is actually a swaggering executive with the dulcet tones of Baldwin, outfitted in little sock garters, with a penchant for sushi and espresso. The two strike a deal: if Tim helps Boss Baby with the PuppyCo. mission, Boss Baby gets his corner office, and Tim gets his parents' full attention back.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>Through their misadventures and antics, the two learn to work together and love each other, and discover that siblings are actually fun for things like imagination playtime and wild harebrained plots to save their parents from the dastardly PuppyCo. CEO Francis Francis (Steve Buscemi). It's the kind of sibling love that one looks back on in fondness, as this film does in bookends, with older Tim voiced by Tobey Maguire.</p>, <p>Most of the movie's laughs are from the cognitive dissonance of Baldwin's voice coming from a large-eyed, adorable blonde baby, and there are some great visual gags — his mouth twists into a pout that is veritably Trumpian — and references that the film incorporates. "Cookies are for closers!" he barks, harkening to Baldwin's memorable speech from "Glengarry Glen Ross." "The Boss Baby" is great fun for parents, but it remains to be seen if kids will get it at all.</p>, <p><strong>"The Boss Baby"</strong> — 2.5 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating</strong>: PG (for some mild rude humor)</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 1:37</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday</p>, <p><strong>RELATED STORIES:</strong></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-zookeepers-wife-mov-rev-0328-20170329-story.html">'The Zookeeper's Wife' review: Jessica Chastain commands the screen with portrayal of WWII hero</a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-dig-two-graves-review-20170321-column.html">'Dig Two Graves' review: Southern Illinois-set supernatural thriller has lifeless plot </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-wilson-mov-rev-0320-20170320-column.html">'Wilson' review: Woody Harrelson doesn't do justice to Daniel Clowes' graphic novel </a></p>, <p>

Check out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.</p>][<p>Jessica Chastain and Daniel Brühl star in "The Zookeeper’s Wife."</p>, <p>Jessica Chastain and Daniel Brühl star in "The Zookeeper’s Wife."</p>, <p>The Holocaust film has become a genre unto itself, and sadly, there are more than enough stories from that era to continue the trend. Against ever-shifting, polarized political landscapes, the lessons gleaned from the horrors of this very recent past are never not relevant. But too often, many of these biopics fall prey to well-trod norms and conventions. In Niki Caro's "The Zookeeper's Wife," the backdrop of a Warsaw zoo offers a new angle, and features a show-stopping performance from Jessica Chastain as the real life Antonina Zabinski, but it otherwise follows a familiar path.</p>, <p>Caro, working from script by Angela Workman adapted from Diane Ackerman's book, smartly places the focus on Antonina. The rest of the plot may go a bit muddy, but when we're trained on our protagonist, it's all crystal clear. In an opening sequence, we witness her unique bond with the animals of the zoo, the power she holds over them with her simple approach of open-hearted love and empathy for all. With tenderness and bravery, she calms an elephant and rescues its baby, and those same qualities make her a hero for humans in the face of unspeakable evil.</p>, <p>The story is one we know, of ordinary people choosing to do extraordinary things to preserve a shred of humanity in times of war and human destruction. Antonina and her husband, Jan (Johan Heldenbergh), decide to harbor Jews from the Warsaw ghetto in the basement of their home while their zoo is occupied by Nazi forces. They hide these "guests" in plain sight with a system of signals, transporting them from Jan's garbage collecting truck to underground tunnels.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>Caro never quite achieves the razor's edge suspense that such a scenario engenders, as their ruse is only one sneeze, one bad lie, one snitch away from discovery. That danger is never fully rendered on screen in the way that it could be. The truly powerful moments come from Chastain's soul-baring performance as a gentle woman who loves enormously, cares diligently, and always does the hard thing when the situation calls for it. She might be a bit too competent for the purposes of cinematic drama.</p>, <p>"The Zookeeper's Wife" delivers a singularly female experience of this war. The male characters are, of course, important, and Heldenbergh and Chastain express a strong chemistry as a couple that is both physically passionate as well as intellectually and ethically aligned. But the perspective is distinctly feminine, and Antonina is unquestionably the hero of the story.</p>, <p>The threat of sexual violence simmers throughout, underneath every interaction between Antonina and Lutz Heck (Daniel Bruhl), an overbearing and cruel Berlin zoologist turned military man, who imposes on their property in the form of supervision over an oxen breeding program he's installed. It's a stark reality that Antonina faces in her darkest times, as well as for Urszula, played by the formidable young Israeli actress Shira Haas, a girl who has experienced the worst crimes of the Nazi soldiers in the Warsaw ghetto. Caro explores this theme unflinchingly but doesn't exploit the material for salaciousness.</p>, <p>Jessica Chastain in "The Zookeeper's Wife." </p>, <p>Jessica Chastain in "The Zookeeper's Wife." </p>, <p>The film's flaws in pacing and suspense are easily overlooked in the shadow of Chastain's moving performance, as well as the performances of those around her. Caro unspools an evergreen tale about the clarifying power of empathy to diffuse fear and hatred.</p>, <p><strong>"The Zookeeper's Wife"</strong> — 3 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating</strong>: PG-13 (for thematic elements, disturbing images, violence, brief sexuality, nudity and smoking)</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 2:04</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday</p>, <p><strong>RELATED STORIES:</strong></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-boss-baby-mov-rev-0329-20170329-story.html">'Boss Baby' review: Fun for parents, maybe not so much for kids</a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-dig-two-graves-review-20170321-column.html">'Dig Two Graves' review: Southern Illinois-set supernatural thriller has lifeless plot </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-wilson-mov-rev-0320-20170320-column.html">'Wilson' review: Woody Harrelson doesn't do justice to Daniel Clowes' graphic novel </a></p>, <p>

Executive producer Haim Saban discovered the "Super Sentai" series on Japanese television in the '80s, and brought the concept of teens in colorful costumes fighting monsters to American audiences in the form of the somewhat silly, but much beloved, "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" series. Now, of course, we have the big screen reboot, for better or for worse.</p>, <p>Joseph Kahn's "Power/Rangers" short film that popped up online in 2015 showed just what a truly dark Power Rangers project could look like, but this version of the "Power Rangers" is about as dark as a CW series: just enough to be taken (somewhat) seriously, but with enough of a sense of humor about itself to have some fun too.</p>, <p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/" target="_blank">MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR</a></strong></p>, <p>The team of screenwriters has brought a sense of levity, as well as realism to the high school dramas, and the film is more about a bunch of oddball teens than it is about colorfully suited karate-chopping superheroes. The first half is "The Breakfast Club" with way more extreme daredevil behavior, as this posse of misfits discover each other and stumble into their startling new powers, by way of five colorful coins they happen to blast out of a mountainside.</p>, <p>The explosives enthusiast is Billy (R.J. Cyler, who steals the whole movie) a neuro-diverse nerd who befriends disgraced football captain Jason (Dacre Montgomery) in detention. Also on the mountain that day are rebellious former cheerleader Kimberly (Naomi Scott), heavy metal yogi Trini (Becky G.) and adrenaline-addled delinquent Zack (Ludi Lin). Soon they're being groomed by a 65-million-year-old alien, Zordon (Bryan Cranston), and a sassy robot, Alpha (Bill Hader), to take on Rita Repulsa (<a href="/topic/entertainment/elizabeth-banks-PECLB0000006305-topic.html" id="PECLB0000006305" title="Elizabeth Banks">Elizabeth Banks</a>), who plans to use Goldar the gold monster to steal the Earth's life crystal.</p>, <p>If the Rangers are on the CW, Banks is in a universe of her own, stalking about the small town of Angel Grove in hobo dominatrix gear, dramatically stage whispering, "GOLD," "CRYSTALS" and "KRISPY KREME" to no one in particular. It's a committed performance that inspires chuckles, but hopefully it's supposed to.</p>, <p>The actual power ranger-ing in the movie is blessedly short, focusing more on character and team building. It's a good thing, because director Dean Israelite and cinematographer Matthew J. Lloyd have a chaotic approach to shooting action. The entire film is dark and murky and the action sequences have no sense of geography. It seems a trend these days to keep the pace blisteringly fast in order to never let the film drag, but the cutting between scenes could give one whiplash.</p>, <p>We are denied a good morphin' sequence though, which was the best, most memorable part of the series. All we get is slow-motion strolling when they could have been wildly peacocking on a cliff's edge.</p>, <p>"Power Rangers" maintains the essence of its origins in that it's rather pleasantly bonkers. It errs on the side of goofy than gritty, and that's to its favor. Trying to take this too seriously would be a mistake. Ultimately, it's not much more than an itch on that nostalgic sweet spot that Hollywood is more than happy to scratch these days.</p>, <p><strong>"Power Rangers"</strong> — 2.5 stars</p>, <p><strong>MPAA rating</strong>: PG-13 (for sequences of sci-fi violence, action and destruction, language and for some crude humor)</p>, <p><strong>Running time</strong>: 2:04</p>, <p><strong>Opens</strong>: Friday</p>, <p><strong>RELATED STORIES:</strong></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-song-to-song-mov-rev-0321-20170321-column.html">'Song to Song' review: Rooney Mara, Ryan Gosling yawp into Terrence Malick's latest existential void  </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-dig-two-graves-review-20170321-column.html">'Dig Two Graves' review: Southern Illinois-set supernatural thriller has lifeless plot </a></p>, <p><a href="/entertainment/movies/sc-wilson-mov-rev-0320-20170320-column.html">'Wilson' review: Woody Harrelson doesn't do justice to Daniel Clowes' graphic novel </a></p>, <p>
