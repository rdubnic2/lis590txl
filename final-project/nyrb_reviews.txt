Mary McCarthy was one of the leading literary figures of her time. In addition to the novels and memoirs for which she is best remembered, she was also a tireless literary and social critic. Starting out as a theater reviewer for Partisan Review in 1937, she quickly distinguished herself for her witty and fearless commentary on topics ranging from McCarthyism to the French New Novel to women's fashion magazines. McCarthy was an eager controversialist, unsparing in her dissection of anything she found phony or hypocritical. Her reviews are sharp, sometimes malicious, and often very funny, but her criticism is also informed by deep erudition and enlivened by an inexhaustible capacity for enthusiasm. Her political writings, critical in equal measure of the Cold War consensus and of its critics, are less concerned with finding correct positions than with exploring the often-absurd circumstances in which agonizing moral decisions are made. While the soundness of McCarthy's judgments can sometimes be doubted, her curiosity and intelligence cannot., The intellectual brio and acute judgment that characterizes her best fiction is vividly displayed in this selection of essays, which span McCarthy's career from the late 1930s to the late 1970s. It includes her writings on topics such as fashion magazines, Eugene O'Neill, "A Streetcar Named Desire," "Look Back in Anger," Pale Fire, J. D. Salinger, Madame Bovary, Italo Calvino, and Watergate.by Mary McCarthy, edited and with an introduction by A.O. Scott, Fierce, provocative, and lovely, a collection of small masterpieces, by one of the twentieth century's most dazzling minds.— Katie Roiphe, Mary McCarthy casts a cold eye on the mundane, the lazy mind, the tribal response, and bad prose. Personal inclination and moral assertion clash in these witty and learned encounters with life and art. A dazzling talent.— Elizabeth Hardwick, McCarthy's essays...display a keen intelligence and freshness of perception, coupled with common sense and an old-fashioned belief in social responsibility.— The New York Times , A Bolt from the Blue distills a half century of McCarthy's nonfiction....Readers of this collection will take immense pleasure in McCarthy's high-speed aphorisms, flawless taxonomies, and chains of reasoning....McCarthy has been lucky in Scott, who put together this collection of her work with real intelligence and enthusiasm.— Thomas Mallon, The Atlantic Monthly  

The distinguished Croatian journalist and publisher Slavko Goldstein says, “Writing this book about my family, I have tried not to separate what happened to us from the fates of many other people and of an entire country.” 1941: The Year That Keeps Returning is Goldstein’s astonishing historical memoir of that fateful year—when the Ustasha, the pro-fascist nationalists, were brought to power in Croatia by the Nazi occupiers of Yugoslavia. On April 10, when the German troops marched into Zagreb, the Croatian capital, they were greeted as liberators by the Croats. Three days later, Ante Pavelic, the future leader of the Independent State of Croatia, returned from exile in Italy and Goldstein’s father, the proprietor of a leftist bookstore in Karlovac—a beautiful old city fifty miles from the capital—was arrested along with other local Serbs, communists, and Yugoslav sympathizers. Goldstein was only thirteen years old, and he would never see his father again. , More than fifty years later, Goldstein seeks to piece together the facts of his father’s last days. The moving narrative threads stories of family, friends, and other ordinary people who lived through those dark times together with personal memories and an impressive depth of carefully researched historic details. The other central figure in Goldstein’s heartrending tale is his mother—a strong, resourceful woman who understands how to act decisively in a time of terror in order to keep her family alive. , From 1941 through 1945 some 32,000 Jews, 40,000 Gypsies, and 350,000 Serbs were slaughtered in Croatia. It is a period in history that is often forgotten, purged, or erased from the history books, which makes Goldstein’s vivid, carefully balanced account so important for us today—for the same atrocities returned to Croatia and Bosnia in the 1990s. And yet Goldstein’s story isn’t confined by geographical boundaries as it speaks to the dangers and madness of ethnic hatred all over the world and the urgent need for mutual understanding.
 
From Notting Hill Editions, The great Victorian designer and decorative artist William Morris was fascinated by Iceland and wrote a book documenting his travels there. He gets caught up with questions of travel, noting his reaction to the idea of leaving or arriving, to hurry and delay, what it means to dread a place you’ve never been to or to encounter the actuality of a long-held vision. He is sensitive to the emotional landscape of his band of travelers and, above all, continuously analyzing and fixing this “most romantic of all deserts.”, Lavinia Greenlaw follows in his footsteps, and interposes his prose with her own “questions of travel.” The result is a new and composite work that brilliantly explores our conflicted reasons for not staying at home., What an original and haunting book! William Morris’s account of his journey through Iceland is touching, quick, vivid, often very funny, while Lavinia Greenlaw’s spare commentary acts as a kind of brilliant x-ray into the deep structures of travel itself. Combined, they form a work of strange and rare enchantment.—James Lasdun, Morris’s journals...are precious and unique because they are so simply and beautifully written with the informed sense of wonder of a deeply learned and sophisticated man. No one except Ruskin has ever put the case for beauty with such vehemence and clarity.—Ian McQueen, The Guardian, At a time of endless half-truths and moral shilly-shallying, Morris’s eccentric integrity shines out.—Fiona McCarthy, Greenlaw has brilliantly found a new form for writing about Morris, and for this we can only be grateful.—Tony Pinkney, William Morris Unbound Blog, The best book of travel written by an English poet is William Morris’s Icelandic Journal.—Geoffrey Grigson 

In this much-anticipated sequel to his critically acclaimed Makers of Modern Architecture (2007), longtime New York Review of Books contributor Martin Filler—"probably the best all-round architecture critic currently working in the United States," according to the architectural journalist David Cohn—offers another penetrating series of concise but authoritative studies on leading exponents of the building art from the late nineteenth to the early twenty-first century. Exemplifying his belief that an architect's personality and character have a direct and profound bearing on this most public and social of art forms, Filler's lively melding of biographical and aesthetic perspectives gives these accessible yet scrupulously researched interpretations a rare human immediacy. From profiles of such universally admired masters as Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier to emerging figures including Michael Arad, creator of New York City's National September 11 Memorial, and the international design collaborative Snohetta, Filler's shifting focus remains consistently trained on the enduring values of great architecture. His panoramic vision encompasses the historically inspired Gilded Age urbanism of the celebrated New York bon vivant Stanford White as well as the expressive collages of ancient and modern elements orchestrated by the reclusive Venetian intellectual Carlo Scarpa. The increasing role of women in architecture is given special emphasis in this new collection, from the pioneering work in 1920s Germany of Margarete Schuette-Lihotzky, inventor of the standardized modern kitchen, to such innovative contemporary practitioners as Elizabeth Diller, Kazuyo Sejima, and Billie Tsien., In this superb follow-up to his first volume of essays on modern building's pioneers and major designers, architecture critic Filler brings his expertise to bear on architects who have been neglected (Carlo Scarpa), those who have fallen out of critical favor (Edward Durell Stone), and others whose standing has been debated (Eero Saarinen), while deftly evaluating the work of contemporaries such as Bernard Tschumi and Snohetta.... A highlight of the collection is Filler's deeply moving essay in support of Michael Arad's National September 11 Memorial—an unforgettable piece of writing that cuts through the media babel that surrounded the memorial's unveiling....his contribution to both architecture criticism and general readers' understanding is invaluable. —Publishers Weekly , Filler writes amazing descriptions of buildings with an ability to maneuver through space with words like a very good perspective drawing: clear, articulate, and very often inspired...Filler's discussions on the method and orchestration of buildings are superb, as is his ability to cite sources and the derivation of architects' work....This brand of criticism is elegant and worldly....—Oculus, The Center for Architecture, Praise for Makers of Modern Architecture, Volume I:, There is only one regular critic in the American press who writes consistently well about architecture and whose pieces are a guaranteed pleasure to revisit—or to read for the first time. He is Martin Filler, whose collection of essays is entitled Makers of Modern Architecture...by far the most intelligent and shapely writing on architecture done in recent years. Filler's opinions are direct, subtle, written with clarity and intense feeling, and (not least in importance) clean of hidden interests: in a field often disfigured and muddied by undeclared allegiances, he is a highly trustworthy critic.—Robert Hughes, The New York Review of Books , This work is a wonderful introduction to 20th-century architecture.... The result is magnificent from start to finish. Filler writes elegant prose that captures the feeling of these buildings in a way that makes illustrations almost unnecessary. He also discusses architecture in a way that will be satisfying both to specialists or practitioners and accessible to nonspecialists. No matter the level of previous experience with architecture, anyone with an interest in the subject will find Filler's work rewarding.—Publishers Weekly , Filler's assessments in The New York Review stand apart, eschewing fashion and offering polished, carefully edited and backed-up, though highly personal, assertions.... Filler's razor-sharp mind and sharper tongue set him apart. We gobble up what he thinks, as well as how he serves it up.—Robert Ivy, Architectural Record , Martin Filler's book is liberating.... For those seeking a brilliant if potted guide to modern architecture, Filler fits the bill. His book bristles with bracing insights, incisive judgments, and wicked lines.—Robert Zaretsky, Houston Chronicle  

This updated edition contains new analysis on the situation in Iraq and the war against terrorism., Sold over 10,000 copies in hardcover., No one outside the intelligence services knows more about their culture than Thomas Powers. In this book he tells stories of shadowy successes, ghastly failures, and, more often, gripping uncertainties. They range from the CIA's long cold war struggle with its Russian adversary to debates about the use of secret intelligence in a democratic society, and urgent contemporary issues such as whether the CIA and the FBI can defend America against terrorism., Essential wartime reading....you get a sense not of what to expect—that's not the job of history—but of the smart questions we need to ask to be confident that we are winning our current secret war.— Timothy Naftali, The New York Times Book Review, A remarkable, twisted tapestry of intrigue.— Ron Rosenbaum, The New York Observer, The most reflective writing about intelligence...Powers deals with the history as well as the bureaucracy of the US intelligence agencies and has a sophisticated grasp of irony, self-delusion, and character.— The Boston Globe, Mr. Powers is one of our most thoughtful writers on espionage....But it's not just that Mr. Powers knows the material; he knows what to make of it.— Dallas Morning News, It is a deeply thought-provoking book—wide-ranging and readable, incisive, expert but without jargon, able to challenge all its own assumptions." —Katharine Sale, Financial Times, These discerning essays span 25 years and provide a revealing history of the victories, defeats and ambiguities of Cold War and post-Cold War intelligence gathering. Powers portrays in vivid human terms repeated FBI failures in counterintelligence, the intelligence agencies' inability to infiltrate terrorist groups, chronic reluctance to share information and a management structure that leaves no one in charge of and accountable for the entire effort....Powers brilliantly conveys the ethos and culture of intelligence agencies—a complexity he has been studying and writing about for almost 30 years....a formidable contribution to the difficult work ahead in re-aligning the intelligence agencies' Cold War-vintage structure.— Lorraine Adams, The Washington Post Book World 

A boy wants a toy horse big enough to ride, but where can his father find it? Not in the stores, which means it’s got to be built from scratch. How? With the help of expert workers, from the carpenter to the painter, working together as one. And now the bold boy is ready to ride off in defense of the future!, Two trams, Click and Zam, are cousins. Click goes out for a day on the tracks and before long he’s so tired he doesn’t know where he is or how to get back. All he knows is he’s got to find Zam. Click is looking for Zam and Zam is looking for Click, and though for a while it seems like nobody knows where to find Click, good and faithful Zam is not to be deterred., Peter’s a car, Vasco’s a steamboat, and Mikey’s a plane. They’re all running like mad and going great guns until, whoops, there’s a big old cow, just a plain old cow, standing in the road. What then?, The early years of the Soviet Union were a golden age for children’s literature. The Fire Horse brings together three classics from the era in which some of Russia’s most celebrated poets, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Osip Mandelstam, and Daniil Kharms, teamed up with some of its finest artists, Lidia Popova, Boris Ender, and Vladimir Konashevich. Brilliantly translated by the poet Eugene Ostashevsky, this is poetry that is as whimsical and wonderful as it is revolutionary., Click to enlarge image, , Pictures by Popova, Ender, and Konashevich, respectively, are wondrous to behold in their own right and as precursors to mid-20th-century Western picture-book art...A glimpse into Soviet children's-book illustration.—Kirkus Reviews, The early Soviet period was a miraculously rich time for children’s books and their illustration. . . The illustrations [to Mandelstam’s Two Trams] display great elegance. The artist, Boris Ender, plays with a very limited palette of colors—black, red and grey, with the occasional touch of light brown—and with simplified shapes, especially the recurring sweep of parallel tramlines. It’s a lovely example of less doing more.—Philip Pullman, A lesser-known product of early Soviet support for the arts was the breathtaking flowering of Soviet children’s literature, as witnessed by NYRB’s The Fire Horse, with its faithful reproductions of three books from 1925 to 1930.—Ainsley Morse, Los Angeles Review of Books Translator Eugene Ostashevsky has cleverly managed to transfer...playful aspects of the verse into English.—Phoebe Taplin, Russia Beyond the Headlines

        Publication Date: March 25, 2014, 2013 National Jewish Book Award Finalist American Library Association Sophie Brody Medal Honor Title 2015, An eczema-riddled Lower East Side haberdasher, Isaac Markowitz, moves to Israel to repair his broken heart and becomes, much to his own surprise, the assistant to a famous old rabbi who daily dispenses wisdom (and soup) to the troubled souls who wash up in his courtyard. It is there that he meets the flame-haired Tamar, a newly religious young American hipster on a mission to live a spiritual life with a spiritual man. Into both of their lives comes Mustafa, a devout Muslim, deformed at birth, a janitor who works on the Temple Mount, holy to both Muslims and Jews. When Mustafa finds an ancient shard of pottery that may date back to the first temple, he brings it to Isaac in friendship. That gesture sets in motion a series of events that lands Isaac in the company of Israel's worst criminal riff raff, puts Mustafa in mortal danger, and leaves Tamar struggling to save them both. As these characters—immigrants and natives; Muslim and Jewish; prophets and lost souls—move through their world, they are never sure if they will fall prey to the cruel tricks of luck or be sheltered by a higher power., Confused about the background of the Gaza conflict? This vibrant evocation of modern Jerusalem may shed some light.—Daily Mail, Romantic, suspenseful and insightful.—Hadassah Magazine, ...[A] beguiling novel...Feuerman writes with grace and wit...'In the Courtyard of the Kabbalist' is as wise as it is heartfelt.—Jewish Week, A delicate balance of courtship tale and thriller.... beautifully detailed and vivid.... I strongly recommend it.—Rebecca Stumpf, Dallas Morning News, A sophisticated and engaging book that treats an endlessly tangled topic—relations between Palestinian Arabs and Jews—with intelligence and originality.... a manifestly terrific novel.—Barton Swaim, The Wall Street Journal, How easy it would have been for Ruchama King Feuerman to write the typical Jerusalem novel, with the typical Middle East obliquities: Arab-Israeli/Israeli-Jew friendship pitted against the external tension of social and political pressures....But Feuerman isn't typical, and in her new book, In the Courtyard of the Kabbalist, she tells a story that is spiritually generous and astutely realistic about an Arab-Israeli and an Israeli-Jew, who may be the most unlikely pair of friends we've seen in current fiction.—The Brooklyn Rail, Feuerman tells a tale of human beings who seek to make connections with each other against all odds....One of the great pleasures of her novel.... is her rich and vivid evocation of contemporary Jerusalem, and especially the people and places in Jerusalem that would not be out of place in a novel by Isaac Bashevis Singer.... She may be the Jewish Jane Austen, but she is also something of a Jewish Graham Greene.—Jonathan Kirsch, Los Angeles Jewish Journal, Feuerman's novel has the most vivid, alive characters, like [the] big huge novels from India by Rohinton Mistry.—Bill McKibben, Boston Globe, A beautiful novel that coils the history and mystery of Jerusalem into a private and vivid tale of personal dignity, ownership, love—and the overlap of all three, the space we call the soul.—Dara Horn, author of Guide for the Perplexed, In the Courtyard of the Kabbalist is ultimately a story of love transcending deformity, both inner and outer.... a book that speaks of seeing beyond appearances: beyond large entities such as the Arab or Jewish collectives to the individual standing before us.... extraordinary, delicate and memorable.—Yael Unterman, Ha'aretz, [A] testament to the power of the imagination.... a rare talent.—Beth Kissileff, The Jerusalem Post, In The Courtyard Of The Kabbalist is a beautifully written, emotionally evocative novel enriched by fascinating characters and an unparalleled portrait of the magical city that is Jerusalem.—Jonathan Kellerman, The descriptions of Jerusalem and its inhabitants in Ruchama King Feuerman's new novel.... are so beautifully detailed and vivid that it's almost as though the city carries its own voice in the narrative. While political turmoil always exists in Feuerman's Jerusalem, it rarely takes center stage. The story is a delicate balance of courtship tale and thriller.... I strongly recommend it for anyone who appreciates fiction about Israel, traditional Jews or the Mideast conflict.—Rebecca Stumpf, Dallas Morning News, [Feuerman] creates a compelling world within a world in Jerusalem. She conveys spiritual longings and the yearnings for human connection, all informed by the heavenly city and its mysteries.—Sandee Brawarsky, Jewish Woman Magazine, In her irresistible novel In the Courtyard of the Kabbalist, Ruchama King Feuerman writes with such contagious affection for her characters that they're likely to supplant your own family until you finish the book. Her Jerusalem, riven though it is by tensions between the sacred and profane, remains an intoxicating place, where diffident lovers inhabit an atmosphere as romantically charged as The Song of Songs.—Steve Stern, author of The Book of Mischief, The emotions in Feuerman's small but gripping story are love and fear.... The tour through [these characters'] hearts and minds, particularly Isaac's and Mustafa's, makes for some of the most deeply interesting, challenging reading of the year.—Marakay Rogers, Broadway Books World, Ruchama Feuerman combines qualities of I.B. Singer touched with the melancholy humor of Sholom Aleichem and Bernard Malamud, sparked with magical realism worthy of Isak Dinesen. Her vision is large and generous. In the Courtyard of the Kabbalist is exactly the kind of book I wish I'd written myself.—Liz Rozenberg, author of The Laws of Gravity, Whose holiness matters? Whose claim on the land is longer, more lasting, more vital? Whose God is best? These most vexing of questions, which trap otherwise smart and even liberal-minded people in boxes they can't seem to get themselves out of, emerge from this one spot in this one city. But what if, Feuerman wonders, a Muslim would offer irrefutable evidence of the Jewish presence on the Temple Mount? And what if a religious Jew would open his heart to save the life (and soul, presumably) of the Muslim? Could the boxes be broken? What if the answers lie right beneath our feet? Feuerman asks these most delectable questions in the form of a fable.... infected, like the novels of Meir Shalev, with a kind of Jewish mystical magical realism. She is a wonderfully empathetic and perceptive writer.... masterful.—Nathaniel Popkin, Cleaver Magazine, The unlikely friendship of an intellectual New York Jew and a working-class Jerusalem Arab drives Feuerman's evocative second novel....

Ruchama King writes with a light touch and great insight. This book is hard to put down.—Alice Elliott Dark, author of In the Gloaming and Think of England, This is a story that toys with, then rejects, cliches, politics, and religious stereotypes.

        Publication Date: March 10, 2015, In the past few decades, several major exhibitions and scholarly publications have revisited the distinguished career of American painter Philip Guston (1913-1980), a fellow at the American Academy in Rome in 1949 and a resident there in 1960 and again in 1971. Once known as "Abstract Expressionism's odd-man out," a respected, but often misunderstood, member of the New York School, Guston is now celebrated for his magisterial paintings of the late 1960s and 1970s. Combining painterly virtuosity and narrative power, they cast a long shadow over the current landscape of contemporary art. In light of both a profusion of recent scholarship and the lasting currency of Guston's vision among artists working today, the time appears right to take stock of his career. To that end, the American Academy in Rome organized a two-day conference with an international roster of critics and art historians to discuss the significance and critical fortunes of Guston's work, paying special attention to his life-long attentiveness to Italian art and culture. Emerging out of that symposium are the texts in Go Figure! They reflect a wide variety of perspectives, including reflections from leading specialists and several of Guston's longtime friends and collaborators, as well as those by younger scholars, who have paved new ground in recent studies of Guston's work. A conversation between Robert Storr and the artist Chuck Close, hosted by the Phillips Collection in 2011, yields further insights. This volume opens new avenues of inquiry complicating the conventional narrative about Guston's purportedly dramatic shift from abstraction to figuration unveiled at the Marlborough show in 1970. More than one hundred years after his birth, Guston continues to fascinate and challenge artists and scholars alike, perhaps more than ever before. Contributors include David Anfam, Dore Ashton, Bill Berkson, Chuck Close, Kosme de Baranano, Barbara Drudi, Susan Behrends Frank, David Kaufmann, David Lewis, Ara H. Merjian, Achille Bonito Oliva, Christoph Schreier, and Robert Slifkin. The book includes 53 color and black and white images. Go Figure! New Perspectives on Guston is published by New York Review Books and the American Academy in Rome.Guston, Peter Benson Miller, preface by Robert Storr

        Publication Date: September 1, 2015, The House of Twenty Thousand Books is the story of Chimen Abramsky, an extraordinary polymath and bibliophile who amassed a vast collection of socialist literature and Jewish history. For more than fifty years Chimen and his wife, Miriam, hosted epic gatherings in their house of books that brought together many of the age’s greatest thinkers., The atheist son of one of the century’s most important rabbis, Chimen was born in 1916 near Minsk, spent his early teenage years in Moscow while his father served time in a Siberian labor camp for religious proselytizing, and then immigrated to London, where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx and became involved in left-wing politics. He briefly attended the newly established Hebrew University in Jerusalem, until World War II interrupted his studies. Back in England, he married, and for many years he and Miriam ran a respected Jewish bookshop in London’s East End. When the Nazis invaded Russia in June 1941, Chimen joined the Communist Party, becoming a leading figure in the party’s National Jewish Committee. He remained a member until 1958, when, shockingly late in the day, he finally acknowledged the atrocities committed by Stalin. In middle age, Chimen reinvented himself once more, this time as a liberal thinker, humanist, professor, and manuscripts’ expert for Sotheby’s auction house., Journalist Sasha Abramsky re-creates here a lost world, bringing to life the people, the books, and the ideas that filled his grandparents’ house, from gatherings that included Eric Hobsbawm and Isaiah Berlin to books with Marx’s handwritten notes, William Morris manuscripts and woodcuts, an early sixteenth-century Bomberg Bible, and a first edition of Descartes’s Meditations. The House of Twenty Thousand Books is a wondrous journey through our times, from the vanished worlds of Eastern European Jewry to the cacophonous politics of modernity., The House of Twenty Thousand Books includes 43 photos., sasha abramsky The paperback edition includes a new preface by the author. , Upcoming events with Sasha Abramsky, Thursday, April 6, 6pm, at Book Passage, 1 Ferry Building, San Francisco, CA, Saturday, April 8, 5pm, at Avid Reader At the Tower, 1600 Broadway, Sacramento, CA, Saturday, April 29, 4pm, at Inkwood Books, 216 S Armenia Ave, Tampa, FL, This is a fierce and beautiful book. It burns with a passion for ideas, the value of history, the need for argument. As a memoir of a grandfather it is sui generis. I loved it.—Edmund de Waal, author of The Hare with Amber Eyes, Sasha Abramsky's account of his grandfather's devotion to books and reading is a moving testimonial to the persistance of human curiosity in a world that seems to drift farther and farther from the delight of intellectual pursuits. It is a moving, instructive, astonishing account of one man's love for the printed word that all readers will appreciate. The House of Twenty Thousand Books deserves twenty hundred thousand readers.— Alberto Manguel, The House of Twenty Thousand Books lovingly recreates an intellectual milieu that was built around old books, chess games, Russian dominoes, Eastern European food, hot tea, family and long evenings spent in spirited political debate.—Michael Dirda, The Washington Post, [Sasha Abramsky] has a knack for swimming deep in the sea of ideas... [He] offers smart, concise pocket explanations of matters ranging from the effect of 18th-century French utopianism on leftist thinking to brief discourses on methodologies of Talmud study...Drawing on numerous interviews with Chimen’s contemporaries and an impressively deep dive into the archives, the book grapples sensitively and honestly with how many of the conversations at 5 Hillway were conducted...In his grandson’s loving, but intellectually responsible tribute, Chimen Abramsky has found his posterity.—Jeremy Dauber, The Wall Street Journal, An evocative, often affecting and remarkably candid chronicle of Chimen [Abramsky’s] life...One of the strategies I most admired about this book is that Sasha chooses to offer succinct essays about the ideas, historical events and personalities that animated his grandfather. Sasha is so vivid a writer that scenes linger in the memory...For anyone who cannot throw away a book, even if it will never be read and even if it ends up crowding a home, The House of Twenty Thousand Books is an affirmation.—Joseph Berger, Haaretz, Vividly written and well-researched, Abramsky’s memoir is seldom less than absorbing.—Jacob HeilbrunnThe National Interest
, A narrative that tells the tale of the 20th century: communists, zionists, fascists, fetishists, secularists and a great scene of academic intrigue. Chimen Abramsky is a worthy subject: his unorthodox intellectual approach and his awe-inspiring collection of books are both marvels to behold. While Abramsky’s grandson writes the story of his life with subtlety and affection, he also evokes the culture of the time in all its foolishness, grandeur, earnestness and ideological disappointment.—Jeff Deutsch, Seminary Co-op Bookstore, [A] warmhearted, frank memoir...Abramsky shares fascinating stories of British intellectual luminaries like Eric Hobsbawm and Isaiah Berlin who were regular visitors to 5 Hillway or close friends of his grandfather...as much as this book is the story of a life of the mind, it's also a tender account of the way this increasingly dilapidated, book-crammed home became for an adoring grandson, 'my school, my university, my library, my sanctuary when the going got tough at home.' Balancing that affection with a sense of awe at the story of his grandfather's fascinating life, Sasha Abramsky has produced a work that will appeal to book lovers and readers of family memoir.—Harvey Freedenberg, Shelf Awareness, Sasha Abramsky’s account rambles into marvelously eclectic corners, from the authentication of incunabula, to the differences between vellum and parchment, to the Rabbinic position on pigskin bindings...Certainly Chimen’s lifelong friendships with Isaiah Berlin, Piero Sraffa, and other twentieth century thinkers will interest many readers. But the most fascinating story is the evolution of Chimen himself—the son with serious rabbinic yichis who rejected religion but ran two Seders a year and never served treyf in his home; the Party member so faithful he eulogized Stalin, until he discovered the lies and turned in his membership card; the book dealer who spent decades curating an exhaustive collection of Socialist literature, only to become one of Europe’s leading collectors of Judaica.

        Publication Date: September 1, 2015, The House of Twenty Thousand Books is the story of Chimen Abramsky, an extraordinary polymath and bibliophile who amassed a vast collection of socialist literature and Jewish history. For more than fifty years Chimen and his wife, Miriam, hosted epic gatherings in their house of books that brought together many of the age’s greatest thinkers., The atheist son of one of the century’s most important rabbis, Chimen was born in 1916 near Minsk, spent his early teenage years in Moscow while his father served time in a Siberian labor camp for religious proselytizing, and then immigrated to London, where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx and became involved in left-wing politics. He briefly attended the newly established Hebrew University in Jerusalem, until World War II interrupted his studies. Back in England, he married, and for many years he and Miriam ran a respected Jewish bookshop in London’s East End. When the Nazis invaded Russia in June 1941, Chimen joined the Communist Party, becoming a leading figure in the party’s National Jewish Committee. He remained a member until 1958, when, shockingly late in the day, he finally acknowledged the atrocities committed by Stalin. In middle age, Chimen reinvented himself once more, this time as a liberal thinker, humanist, professor, and manuscripts’ expert for Sotheby’s auction house., Journalist Sasha Abramsky re-creates here a lost world, bringing to life the people, the books, and the ideas that filled his grandparents’ house, from gatherings that included Eric Hobsbawm and Isaiah Berlin to books with Marx’s handwritten notes, William Morris manuscripts and woodcuts, an early sixteenth-century Bomberg Bible, and a first edition of Descartes’s Meditations. The House of Twenty Thousand Books is a wondrous journey through our times, from the vanished worlds of Eastern European Jewry to the cacophonous politics of modernity., The House of Twenty Thousand Books includes 43 photos., sasha abramsky The paperback edition includes a new preface by the author. , Upcoming events with Sasha Abramsky, Thursday, April 6, 6pm, at Book Passage, 1 Ferry Building, San Francisco, CA, Saturday, April 8, 5pm, at Avid Reader At the Tower, 1600 Broadway, Sacramento, CA, Saturday, April 29, 4pm, at Inkwood Books, 216 S Armenia Ave, Tampa, FL, This is a fierce and beautiful book. It burns with a passion for ideas, the value of history, the need for argument. As a memoir of a grandfather it is sui generis. I loved it.—Edmund de Waal, author of The Hare with Amber Eyes, Sasha Abramsky's account of his grandfather's devotion to books and reading is a moving testimonial to the persistance of human curiosity in a world that seems to drift farther and farther from the delight of intellectual pursuits. It is a moving, instructive, astonishing account of one man's love for the printed word that all readers will appreciate. The House of Twenty Thousand Books deserves twenty hundred thousand readers.— Alberto Manguel, The House of Twenty Thousand Books lovingly recreates an intellectual milieu that was built around old books, chess games, Russian dominoes, Eastern European food, hot tea, family and long evenings spent in spirited political debate.—Michael Dirda, The Washington Post, [Sasha Abramsky] has a knack for swimming deep in the sea of ideas... [He] offers smart, concise pocket explanations of matters ranging from the effect of 18th-century French utopianism on leftist thinking to brief discourses on methodologies of Talmud study...Drawing on numerous interviews with Chimen’s contemporaries and an impressively deep dive into the archives, the book grapples sensitively and honestly with how many of the conversations at 5 Hillway were conducted...In his grandson’s loving, but intellectually responsible tribute, Chimen Abramsky has found his posterity.—Jeremy Dauber, The Wall Street Journal, An evocative, often affecting and remarkably candid chronicle of Chimen [Abramsky’s] life...One of the strategies I most admired about this book is that Sasha chooses to offer succinct essays about the ideas, historical events and personalities that animated his grandfather. Sasha is so vivid a writer that scenes linger in the memory...For anyone who cannot throw away a book, even if it will never be read and even if it ends up crowding a home, The House of Twenty Thousand Books is an affirmation.—Joseph Berger, Haaretz, Vividly written and well-researched, Abramsky’s memoir is seldom less than absorbing.—Jacob HeilbrunnThe National Interest
, A narrative that tells the tale of the 20th century: communists, zionists, fascists, fetishists, secularists and a great scene of academic intrigue. Chimen Abramsky is a worthy subject: his unorthodox intellectual approach and his awe-inspiring collection of books are both marvels to behold. While Abramsky’s grandson writes the story of his life with subtlety and affection, he also evokes the culture of the time in all its foolishness, grandeur, earnestness and ideological disappointment.—Jeff Deutsch, Seminary Co-op Bookstore, [A] warmhearted, frank memoir...Abramsky shares fascinating stories of British intellectual luminaries like Eric Hobsbawm and Isaiah Berlin who were regular visitors to 5 Hillway or close friends of his grandfather...as much as this book is the story of a life of the mind, it's also a tender account of the way this increasingly dilapidated, book-crammed home became for an adoring grandson, 'my school, my university, my library, my sanctuary when the going got tough at home.' Balancing that affection with a sense of awe at the story of his grandfather's fascinating life, Sasha Abramsky has produced a work that will appeal to book lovers and readers of family memoir.—Harvey Freedenberg, Shelf Awareness, Sasha Abramsky’s account rambles into marvelously eclectic corners, from the authentication of incunabula, to the differences between vellum and parchment, to the Rabbinic position on pigskin bindings...Certainly Chimen’s lifelong friendships with Isaiah Berlin, Piero Sraffa, and other twentieth century thinkers will interest many readers.

        Publication Date: April 7, 2015, What is really going on here? For decades Renata Adler has been asking and answering this question with unmatched urgency. In her essays and long-form journalism, she has captured the cultural zeitgeist, distrusted the accepted wisdom, and written stories that would otherwise go untold. As a staff writer at The New Yorker from 1963 to 2001, Adler reported on civil rights from Selma, Alabama; on the war in Biafra, the Six-Day War, and the Vietnam War; on the Nixon impeachment inquiry and Congress; on cultural life in Cuba. She has also written about cultural matters in the United States, films (as chief film critic for The New York Times), books, politics, television, and pop music. Like many journalists, she has put herself in harm’s way in order to give us the news, not the “news” we have become accustomed to—celebrity journalism, conventional wisdom, received ideas—but the actual story, an account unfettered by ideology or consensus. She has been unafraid to speak up when too many other writers have joined the pack. In this sense, Adler is one of the few independent journalists writing in America today., This collection of Adler’s nonfiction draws on Toward a Radical Middle (a selection of her earliest New Yorker pieces), A Year in the Dark (her film reviews), and Canaries in the Mineshaft (a selection of essays on politics and media), and also includes uncollected work from the past two decades. The more recent pieces are concerned with, in her words, “misrepresentation, coercion, and abuse of public process, and, to a degree, the journalist’s role in it.” With a brilliant literary and legal mind, Adler parses power by analyzing language: the language of courts, of journalists, of political figures, of the man on the street. In doing so, she unravels the tangled narratives that pass for the resolution of scandal and finds the threads that others miss, the ones that explain what really is going on here—from the Watergate scandal, to the “preposterous” Kenneth Starr report submitted to the House during the Clinton impeachment inquiry, to the plagiarism and fabrication scandal of the former New York Times reporter Jayson Blair. And she writes extensively about the Supreme Court and the power of its rulings, including its fateful decision in Bush v. Gore.by Renata Adler, preface by Michael Wolff, One of the most important postwar writers (and prose stylists), Adler here covers everything from generational silliness to civil rights in the South. It’s all the harder to put down because it sometimes boils your blood.—Flavorwire, Selected as one of “The Best Books of 2015” by Vulture/NYMag.com, 
, Selected as one of Publishers Weekly‘s Top Ten Spring 2015 Politics titles., Two years after the reappearance in print of her novels Speedboat and Pitch Dark, Adler has returned again as a reporter, essayist, and critic — one of the best we’ve had on all three fronts. The new collection charts her progression from reporter to Yale Law–trained parser of constitutional betrayals and journalistic malpractice, and the truth is, though she’s been near-silent for some time, she only ever got better.—Vulture/NYMag.com, Renata Adler is a clarion, often controversial critic, reporter, and novelist highly visible in the 1960s and 1970s. She was as tuned-in to the zeitgeist and as intrepid in her interpretation and articulation as Joan Didion and Susan Sontag…After the Tall Timber is a sumptuously intelligent and exhilarating collection by a courageous and committed writer of integrity, artistry, and independence. A provocative and elevating book that recalibrates journalistic standards, and sharpens our perception of the recent past and its influence on our even more harrowing present. Readers will hope that Adler’s triumphant return to print will open the way for new works. We need Adler’s brilliance, wit, and lucidity.—Booklist, The eloquent and combative essayist Renata Adler presents dispatches from the frontlines of the 1960s and ‘70s.—Everett Jones, Publishers Weekly, She is one of the most brilliant—that is, vivid, intense, astute, and penetrating—essayists in contemporary letters, and most contrarian: much of what you think she will passionately undo. —Michael Wolff, The Guardian, Fiercely argued, sharp-witted…Adler, whose writing for The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Atlantic Monthly, The New York Review of Books, The New Republic, Harper’s, and Vanity Fair has enlightened and enraged so many, is just whom we need for some perspective on our strange new world. —Daily News, Acutely reasoned to the point of wittiness, and occasionally outright funny…[Adler] most visibly dramatizes…the contest of a single reasonable mind against the brute forces of institutional behavior.—Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, The New York Times, An observer of acute intelligence and discriminating sensibility. —Encounter, Nobody writes better prose than Renata Adler. —John Leonard, Vanity Fair, Adler’s opinions are as reasoned as they are relentless….These selections, united by a persistent theme of the “misrepresentation, coercion, and abuse of public process, and… the journalist’s role in it,” demonstrate that Adler’s uncompromising insistence on accuracy and accountability is what ultimately makes her writing so incisive.—Publishers Weekly

        Publication Date: March 14, 2017, The Pirate Who Does Not Know the Value of Pi is a poem-novel about the relationship between a pirate and a parrot who, after capturing a certain quantity of prizes, are shipwrecked on a deserted island, where they proceed to discuss whether they would have been able to communicate with people indigenous to the island, had there been any. Characterized by multilingual punning, humor puerile and set-theoretical, philosophical irony and narrative handicaps, Eugene Ostashevsky’s new large-scale project draws on sources as various as early modern texts about pirates and animal intelligence, old-school hip-hop, and game theory to pursue the themes of emigration, incomprehension, untranslatability, and the otherness of others., Upcoming events for The Pirate Who Does Not Know the Value of Pi with Eugene Ostashevsky:, Mon, April 3, 4:30pm at Princeton University, 249 East Pyne, Princeton, NJ, hosted by the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, Tues, April 4, 7:30pm at Greenlight Bookstore, 686 Fulton St., Brooklyn, NY, with Elif Batuman, Wednesday, April 5, 8pm at The Poetry Project, 131 E 10th St., New York City, with Uljana Wolf, Thursday, April 6, 7pm at Hunter College, 695 Park Avenue, New York City, hosted by the Department of Classical and Oriental Studies, Sunday, April 9, 3pm, the jubilat/Jones Reading Series at Jones Library, 43 Amity St., Amherst, MA, Wednesday, April 12, 7pm, at Grolier Poetry Book Shop, 6 Plympton St., Cambridge, MA, Thursday, April 13, 12pm, at the Barker Center, Harvard University, 12 Quincy Street, Cambridge, MA, This isn’t just a book: It is a multi-vocal orchestra. It performs some of the most playful, surprising, and innovative musical effects of our day. Yet at the center of all this play there is the large emptiness of loss. Loss, the mother of metaphysics.—Ilya Kaminsky, In this collection language is examined and experienced as a source of bafflement, tragedy, and pleasure. The poems are deftly woven from a variety of languages, traditions, and texts. Ostashevsky, whose first language is Russian, spins his song from the displacements and discoveries of his own voyages for our reading pleasure...Despite being buffeted by storm and shipwreck and existential questions, our pirate and parrot never lose their balance. Neither does Ostashevsky in this hilarious, deeply serious, collection.—Elizabeth T. Gray, Jr., Hyperallergic, Language of every kind is at the heart of Ostashevsky’s little book of prose-poetry...This poetry captures emotional realities with moments of fleeting lyricism.... The ridiculous jokes and whimsical soundscapes are all part of the poet’s exploration of unfathomable, tragicomic human experience.—Phoebe Taplin, Russia Beyond the Headlines, The Russian-American author of this deliciously sardonic parable of the non sequitur can find no assurance that things in this world happen for a reason. On the contrary, his is a poetic universe where, to cite Wittgenstein, "everything we see could always be otherwise."—Marjorie Perloff on The Life and Opinions of DJ Spinoza, The Pirate Who Does Not Know the Value of Pi deals with the fundamental inability of language as means of expression, utilising a lively and irreverent sense of humour in making the most complex of subjects accessible and familiar with a clarity and irony which warms and disconcerts simultaneously. There is a lyric and musical quality to his poetry informed by the traditions of jazz, early New York Music Hall comedy and the pirating life.—Eve Richens, The Quietus

        Publication Date: March 7, 2017, Also available in hardcover. , Before heading off to war Major Palfrey reminds his two daughters, Dinah and Dorinda, to be good while he is gone. But the sisters aren’t sure that they can do it. As Dinah admits, “I think that we are quite likely to be bad, however hard we try not to be.” Sure enough, the sisters soon are up to their usual mischief. They convince a judge that minds must be changed as often as socks, stage an escape from the local zoo (thanks to a witch’s potion that turns them into kangaroos), and—in the company of a golden puma and silver falcon—set off to rescue their father from the wicked tyrant of Bombardy. Written at the height of World War II, this tale of hilarity and great adventure is also a work of high seriousness; after all, “life without freedom,” as the valiant puma makes clear, “is a poor, poor thing.”, Click to enlarge image, , A wildly inventive fantasy that just begs to be read aloud.—The Horn Book Magazine, I remember the feeling of wildness the title [The Wind on the Moon] evoked, the sense of branches and clouds shaking against a strange light. There is a great deal of night in the book, but it is a protecting, welcoming, transforming darkness, where the bold are rewarded. The Wind on the Moon is a wartime book.... It is not a prisoner of the time, though, and one of its delights is the cavalier way in which Linklater swings between pure fantasy and the everyday made fantastic. [Nicolas Bentley’s] elegant, spare line drawings round out the richness of the book.—James Meek, The Guardian, Eric Linklater’s delightful fantasy belongs in that section of the bookshelf alongside Alice in Wonderland, The Jungle Book, and The Wind in the Willows because it shares the same quality of believable magic.—Saturday Review

        Publication Date: July 19, 2004, Many Democrats in the Senate are fearful of George W. Bush and "his unscrupulous political strategist, Karl Rove," writes Elizabeth Drew. The House, meanwhile, is run by Republican Whip Tom DeLay, "the mean-spirited partisan from Texas" who has polarized the chamber along party lines., How did we get to this point under a president who ran on a promise to unite rather than divide, and how has our government been affected?, Elizabeth Drew's answers to these questions begin by exposing the cynicism of the Bush presidential campaign, orchestrated by Rove. She also reveals the deep division between the neocons in the Defense Department and the realists in the State Department. The controversy between the two camps, she finds, has "brought out bitterness and knife-wielding of a sort that Washington has seldom seen." The result, she concludes, is that "the increasing unwillingness to compromise is not only blocking legislation but, it is not overdramatic to say, is subverting fundamental concepts of democracy.", Russell Baker in his preface writes: "In Washington an age of moral and philosophical sterility is deeply entrenched, and as Elizabeth Drew's reporting attests, the result is not pretty .... Since [the end of the cold war] government has seemed to be mostly about raising money to get elected, and then reelected repeatedly in order to service those who put up the money. There is no moral urgency in it, no philosophical imperative at work."Elizabeth Drew, In Washington an age of moral and philosophical sterility is deeply entrenched, and as Elizabeth Drew's reporting attests, the result is not pretty....Since [the end of the Cold War] government has seemed to be mostly about raising money to get elected, and then reelected repeatedly in order to service those who put up the money.

        Publication Date: November 15, 2011, Twenty-seven memoirs of transforming personal and intellectual relationships among writers and artists from the pages of The New York Review of Books. Many of the contributors to The New York Review of Books have written about deep and abiding relationships— both personal and intellectual—with fellow poets, writers, and artists. The Company They Kept, Volume II is a collection of twenty-seven accounts of these friendships that were always stimulating, often inspiring, and sometimes vexing (as Robert Lowell writes about John Berryman: "Hyperenthusiasms made him a hot friend, and could also make him wearing to friends—one of his dearest, Delmore Schwartz, used to say no one had John's loyalty, but you liked him to live in another city"). There are historic moments—Isaiah Berlin's conversations with Boris Pasternak and Anna Akhmatova, Hector Bianciotti's account of the death of Borges—as well as lighthearted ones—Bruce Chatwin's hilarious drunken evening with George Ortiz, and Arthur Gold and Robert Fizdale's subway ride with George Balanchine ("...like a mythical guide he made the dingy steps, the sinister train, the underground arrival at the State Theater a Tiepoloesque flight into heaven"). Many of the portraits include vivid images that otherwise would have been lost forever: the poet Osip Mandelstam, whom Anna Akhmatova first glimpsed as "a thin young boy with a twig of lily-of-the-valley in his button-hole"; the young Gore Vidal in Dawn Powell's living room suddenly realizing "this is a menage a trois in Greenwich Village. My martini runs over"; twelve-year-old aspiring cartoonist John Updike writing Saul Steinberg to ask for a cartoon (Steinberg sent one, and another, nearly fifty years later, when Updike turned sixty). Each portrait is written with feeling and fullness of heart. A sense of the intimacy and verve of the memoirs is captured in Darryl Pinckney's description of the premises of The New York Review of Books itself, from whose offices these writings were edited and in whose pages they first appeared: "Books were streaking across the ocean and galleys were zooming in from the West Coast or the East Side, nearly all by messenger, by overnight delivery, because everything was urgent, every contributor was at the center of a drama called his or her 'piece.' Incredible battles went on during press week as indescribable things rotted in the office refrigerator. Someone's laughter in the typesetting studio would provoke to fury someone doing layout next door and the storms, the slammed doors. It was a family." The New York Review of Books, with an international circulation of more than 130,000, began during New York's 1963 newspaper strike when the present editor, Robert B. Silvers, and founding co-editor Barbara Epstein, along with Jason Epstein, Elizabeth Hardwick, and Robert Lowell, decided to create a new kind of magazine—one in which the most interesting and qualified minds would discuss current books and issues in depth. Since then, every two weeks, The New York Review has continued to be the journal where the most important issues in American life, culture, and politics are discussed by writers who are themselves a major force in world literature and thought. "The secret of its success, The New York Times wrote, "is this: Its editors' ability to get remarkable writers and thinkers, many of them specialists in their fields, to write lucidly for lay readers on an enormous range of complex, scholarly and newly emerging subjects, issues and ideas.", Anna Akhmatova on Osip MandelstamVirgil Thomson on Gertrude SteinJonathan Miller on Lenny BruceRobert Lowell on John BerrymanStephen Spender on W.

        Publication Date: March 14, 2017, A fine young man—a fine young failure too—I’m home to bring my aged mother shame., Li He is the bad-boy poet of the late Tang dynasty. He began writing at the age of seven and died at twenty-six from alcoholism or, according to a later commentator, “sexual dissipation,” or both. An obscure and unsuccessful relative of the imperial family, he would set out at dawn on horseback, pause, write a poem, and toss the paper away. A servant boy followed him to collect these scraps in a tapestry bag., Long considered far too extravagant and weird for Chinese taste, Li He was virtually excluded from the poetic canon until the mid-twentieth century. Today, as the translator and scholar Anne M. Birrell, writes, “Of all the Tang poets, even of all Chinese poets, he best speaks for our disconcerting times.” Modern critics have compared him to Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Keats, and Trakl., The Collected Poems of Li He is the only comprehensive selection of his surviving work (most of his poems were reputedly burned by his cousin after his death, for the honor of the family), rendered here in crystalline translations by the noted scholar J. D. Frodsham., Frodsham has...developed aspects of Li He’s biography, generally presenting them more succinctly...Certainly, Professor Frodsham’s finely wrought translation of Li He remains the most cultured of those recent attempts to render into English this intractable, culture-bound Chinese poet.—Anne M. Birrell, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland

        Publication Date: March 10, 2015, A deeply considered and provocative new look at major American writers—including Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer, and W.H. Auden—Edward Mendelson's Moral Agents is also a work of critical biography in the great tradition of Plutarch, Samuel Johnson, and Emerson. Any important writer, in Mendelson's view, writes in response to an idea of the good life that is inseparable from the life the writer lives., Fusing biography and criticism and based on extensive new research, Moral Agents presents challenging new portraits of eight writers—novelists, critics, and poets—who transformed American literature in the turbulent twentieth century. Eight sharply distinctive individuals—inspired, troubled, hugely ambitious—who reimagined what it means to be a writer., There's Saul Bellow, a novelist determined to rule as a patriarch, who, having been neglected by his father, in turn neglected his son in favor of young writers who presented themselves as his literary heirs. Norman Mailer's extraordinary ambition, suppressed insecurity, and renegade metaphysics muddled the novels through which he hoped to change the world, yet these same qualities endowed him with an uncanny sensitivity and deep sympathy to the pathologies of American life that make him an unequaled political reporter. William Maxwell wrote sad tales of small-town life and surrounded himself with a coterie of worshipful admirers. As a powerful editor at The New Yorker, he exercised an enormous and constraining influence on American fiction that is still felt today., Preeminent among the critics is Lionel Trilling, whose Liberal Imagination made him a celebrity sage of the anxiously tranquilized 1950s, even as his calculated image of Olympian reserve masked a deeply conflicted life and contributed to his ultimately despairing worldview. Dwight Macdonald, by contrast, was a haute-WASP anarchist and aesthete driven by an exuberant moral commitment, in a time of cautious mediocrity, to doing the right thing. Alfred Kazin, from a poor Jewish emigre background, remained an outsider at the center of literary New York, driven both to escape from and do justice to the deepest meanings of his Jewish heritage., Perhaps most intriguing are the two poets, W.H. Auden and Frank O'Hara. Early in his career, Auden was tempted to don the mantle of the poet as prophet, but after his move from England to America he lived and wrote in a spirit of modesty and charity born out of a deeply idiosyncratic understanding of Christianity. O'Hara, tireless partygoer and pioneering curator at MoMA, wrote much of his poetry for private occasions. Its lasting power has proven to be something different from its avant-garde reputation: personal warmth, individuality, rootedness in ancient traditions, and openness to the world., In Moral Agents Edward Mendelson has written an original and unsettling group portrait of the literary generation just past. These essays are rich in quotation, precise in judgment, and unified by a premise they test in detail: that literature is most invigorating when it teaches us how to live. Mendelson is rare among contemporary critics in his treatment of writing as a form of personal action.—David Bromwich, Yale University, Edward Mendelson's observations about literature are among the best I have read: deeply knowledgeable, appreciate and attentive, and expressed with the affinity of a scholar and critic who is himself an excellent writer.—Shirley Hazzard, Each chapter contains a biographical profile and an assessment of the writer based on his response to some of the burning issues of the day, from the rise of communism to the sexual revolution. Mendelson's focus on "the conflicts between the inward, intimate private lives of the eight authors and the lives they led in public" ties the essays together...Those interested in the role these writers played as public intellectuals—and in the larger issue of the relationship of literature to politics—will welcome this engaging read.—Library Journal, Drawing on unique familiarities, Mendelson, like his subjects, becomes a public intellectual, offering insightful, well-crafted sketches that will entertain and edify a broad audience.—R. Mulligan, CHOICE

        Publication Date: February 15, 2004, Now in paperback, From his youthful days as a delivery boy for William Randolph Hearst's Baltimore newspapers through his many years as a journalist and commentator, Russell Baker has been a keen observer of American politics and culture. Now, in these eleven essays, all originally published in The New York Review of Books, he looks back on a group of iconic public figures from his own past., Profiled here are presidents (Lyndon Johnson feuding with Robert F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon in his grasping, spectral exile), would-be presidents (Eugene V. Debs and Barry Goldwater, "gentlemen fallen among brutes"), and those who set their sights on something besides the presidency (Joe DiMaggio, and Martin Luther King, "the one indisputably great American of the century's second half")., Undeluded by the roar of what he calls "our national engines of ballyhoo, bushwah, and baloney," Russell Baker reflects on the strange fascination that these larger-than-life characters have held for the American imagination. With an elegiac yet shrewd sense of their accomplishments both enduring and ephemeral, he traces the impressions they left on twentieth-century America—and on him., A refresher course in American politics and culture.— Tampa Tribune &amp; Times, [Baker displays] an unflinching desire to observe lives as they were actually lived, not as they were created by Hollywood.— The Boston Globe, Baker wrote wonderfully, with perfect, witty sentences that could make you stop and read them again.— The Boston Globe, [Baker has] scholarly erudition, stylistic flair, and an ability to sweep through all manner of culture high and low that recalls writers like Edmund Wilson and George Orwell.— Boston Phoenix
