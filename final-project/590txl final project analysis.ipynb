    "## Research Question\n",
    "My research question is relatively simple: what can we learn about movie reviews and video games when testing if they can be reliably classified in comparison to each other, when we look at their top and bottom words and when examining sentiment? A lot is written and said by video game fans, journalists, developers, producers and studios about the medium's status as art. Often individuals representing these communities lament the general skepticism to video games as art. But do journalists speak about video games the same way that journalists speak about movies? For many, a review is the first entry to a piece--film or game--and the language used can influence the reader to "

       "Columns: [Teeming with acts both heroic and reprehensible,  John Ridley’s wrenchingly humane documentary,  “Let It Fall: Los Angeles 1982-1992, ” reveals the Los Angeles riots as the almost inevitable culmination of a decade of heightening racial tensions.,  To that end,  this multiethnic oral history allows politicians and the police,  victims and survivors who witnessed the events of April 29 and 30,  1992,  to expose a relentless accretion of official decisions and public resentments. We’re almost 90 minutes in before the uprising begins,  but not a second feels unnecessary: Rather,  some sections are so powerfully elucidated by the movie’s commitment to context and nuance that even too-familiar tragedies — like the agonizing beatings of Rodney King and Reginald Denny — arrive freighted with fresh insight.,  \"Let It Fall\" takes a look at the years and events leading up to the city-wide violence that began April 29,  1992.1,  when the verdict was announced in the Rodney King case.,  “It was truly a war like no other, ” says Jung Hui Lee,  a Korean-American shopkeeper whose 18-year-old son,  Edward Jae Song Lee,  was mistaken for a looter and shot while trying to protect another business. His death,  like others in the film,  is indicative of a chaos that defies a simple black-and-white explanation.,  Drawing from multiple visual sources,  Mr. Ridley follows the rise of gang membership and drug use,  and the troubling evolution of the policing tactic known as “pain compliance” (an escalating series of actions designed to subdue a suspect). Neither blame nor absolution entices him as,  again and again (eased by Colin Rich’s masterly editing),  he coaxes forth the perfect,  shining moment that speaks volumes.,  “He was only 20, ” one woman says,  distractedly,  of the boyfriend who died from a police chokehold,  as if she were fully registering his youth for the first time. Similarly,  a telling encounter with a biracial juror plays like a spotlight on the complexities of tribal loyalty. But Mr. Ridley (whose terrific anthology series,  “American Crime, ” is currently in its third season on ABC) saves his most devastating device for last,  sideswiping us with the realization that someone who has already touched our hearts might also,  at one time,  have turned our stomachs.The cinema innovator and iconoclast Jean-Luc Godard never actually said,  “All you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun, ” but it has become a well-known adage,  anyway — because it’s true. “Free Fire, ” directed by Ben Wheatley from a script he wrote with Amy Jump,  applies a more-is-more ethos to the formula: The ingredients here include a best actress Academy Award winner,  Brie Larson; dozens of firearms; and a slew of male characters of varying levels of smugness and idiocy to help out with the shooting. The film is a formal exercise in spectacle under constraint: An extended standoff in a contained space surprisingly full of hazards.,  The director Ben Wheatley narrates a sequence from the film.,  The story is set in the era of eight-track tapes and ultrawide lapels. Cillian Murphy plays an Irish gun buyer with a cause; Armie Hammer,  Sharlto Copley and Babou Ceesay are among the idiosyncratic sleazebags doing the selling. The deal is going down in a grungy abandoned warehouse in Boston,  with Ms. Larson’s character,  Justine,  acting as broker. Before things can conclude amicably,  an unpleasant coincidence-among-lowlifes sets the gangs against each other. All hell breaks loose,  ebbs,  breaks loose again,  and so on.,  Mr. Wheatley’s “High-Rise” was a highlight of 2016,  and again he shows that he’s a technically virtuosic director whose humor has a bracingly nasty side. He’s also no dummy. “Free Fire” is an action movie finely tuned to even the most potentially vicious audiences’ tolerances. It is filled with mayhem,  but avoids grisly violence — at least until the finale pulls out some gory,  and not inapt,  punch lines.,  Luxuriating in disreputability in all the right ways,  the film also contains no shortage of profane verbal wit: From an impeccably delivered “Ugh,  men, ” from Ms. Larson,  to a one-bit gunman’s complaint about hating a certain type of “freelance job” that he describes with an expletive.A funny thing happened to the French director Bruno Dumont a few years back: He discovered whimsy,  or at least something like it. Mr. Dumont made his feature debut in 1997,  with the striking “The Life of Jesus, ” which built on the unflinching confrontation of emotional extremes pioneered by the filmmaker Maurice Pialat. His subsequent works — including the harrowing “Twentynine Palms, ” the enigmatic war film “Flanders” and the gloss on Bressonian themes “Hadewijch” — are serious,  searing pictures,  replete with content and imagery that even the most adventurous viewer could find hard to stomach.,  But his 2014 television mini-series,  “Li’l Quinquin, ” about an impish kid caught up in a grisly murder mystery,  added an antic playfulness to the Dumont vocabulary. And his new feature,  “Slack Bay, ” widens that scope.,  “Slack Bay” is set in a tiny seaside community in northern France,  sometime in the early 1900s. Here live two families. The “haves” are the wealthy Van Peteghems,  whose patriarch,  André (Fabrice Luchini),  a simpering hunchback,  presides (after a fashion) over an ominous stone manse on a hill overlooking the bay. The “have-nots” are the Bruforts,  whose own patriarch is nicknamed the Eternal. They run a ferry service in which the Eternal and his oldest son,  called Ma Loute (also the film’s French title),  often hand-carry passengers over a marsh. Sometimes they use a boat. And on these trips they sometimes bludgeon their passengers to death,  take the bodies to their humble home and eat them.,  Into this mix blunder a pair of black-suited,  derby-wearing police officers who would look as at home in “The Adventures of Tintin” as they might in a Mack Sennett short. One is overweight,  and makes a lot of noise if he so much as crooks an elbow in his tightfitting suit. He also falls and rolls around a lot. Mr. Dumont is defiantly not above body-shaming humor. He probably has some philosophical rationale for it.,  But wait.
